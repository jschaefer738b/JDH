My dear Dyer
I have had a very hard


5 days of it as you may suppose
with my work, Lawyers, my
sister & the duties of Society in
a friend's house; but I have got


through, shall sign the Report of
my Juries (as Chairman) at the
railway station tomorrow, & get
to Kew by night fall


I am very sorry to hear of the
Jecur being enlarged, I hope it
will not be a troublesome case
but I know it will take


time.
I shall go up & down to Sunningdale
whilst Reggie & Grace are there
before home, spending the day


at Kew
The Foresty exhibition is on
the whole as good as I expected,
the Japanese is most interesting


& far the best, Indian is
heterogeneous, Guiana,
very rich but not ticketed
I find a due sense amongst


the Juries of the necessity of
scientfic ticketing -- we make
it a prominent feature of of


the Reports.
The Doctoring was really
an imposing affair --  I never


had so much butter poured over
me at a time.
Dr Lyons was on my Jury & I


got on extremely well with him --
We did not touch on birch[?]
Forests.


It is good news that Harriet
is so much better, my love &
Mater's to her -- she will be


glad to have you at Eastbourne
both
let us know how you get
on & Believe me ever


Affectionately yrs
JDHooker



I paid a flying visit to the
Garden, which is wonderfully
improved since  McNab's time
