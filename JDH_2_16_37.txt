My dear Dyer
Thanks for your
capital letter. We arrived here
yesterday afternoon after a long
night journey from Stirling
which we left at 9 on the
previous evening. The most
interesting thing I have seen
since I last wrote is Sir. Mr. Stirling
Maxwell's house at Keir near
Stirling -- he was not at home

but the house keeper took me
over & I was amazed at the
wealth of articles of historic
interest & beauty, pictures,
portraits, engravings, glass, china,
old -- silver -- & stone work, furniture,
fittings &c &c &c  & all arranged with

growth -- & this was the great contrast
well arranged
to most of the gorgeous modern
houses -- which are evidently made to
hold
fit the furniture & decorative
&
objects, whether of art or use. This
on the contrary
is an old house, the various
adjusted &
parts of which were utilised for
instructive
the display of art collections &
fitted up coloured &c with
reference to the contents. The

I suppose that it was a very
extensive one: he used to
profess to care little for any
Herb. of his own if I remember
aright. I have still to get
from Oliver a list of the collections

I am aghast at the Linnean

Edgeworth's work was worthless
& that it is his brain that is
wrong. & that probably not one of
his drawings is truly accurate, whilst
no inconsiderable number are

The plates damn themselves -
I will speak to Bentham when I
return -- but I did so as strongly
as possible before the paper went
in; & again when you & I heard of
the publication. It is Curry &
Allman who are most to
blame, as is W. Smith in not
putting his opinion in writing
for the Council.

subjects that have come under

provide matter enough & I can
throw in a few scientific observations
bearing upon them. I thought
of alluding to Williamson's papers
on Fossil Botany & two or three
remarkable points, as Hector's
discoveries in N. Z., Sapotas &
the general question of temperate
forests in arctic regions in order to
introduce some cautions
