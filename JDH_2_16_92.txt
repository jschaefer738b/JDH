My dear Dyer
I am writing to
Lubbock that Tuesday will not
suit me. -- any other day would.
I am sure you can make an
âˆž better plan of the Offices than


Lepelle,- the position of which
puzzles me
I have just seen Smith
who has had one of his heart
attacks, but mild- & expects to
be all right again tomorrow. -- He
had not sent for Dr Anderson.
The Rock Garden is gorgeous


I have taken Aitchison's
letter to decipher & digest --
I have written to him about
his Rose, a month ago.
I shall be at Kew on
Monday


Love to Harrriet
Ever affey yr
Jos D Hooker
