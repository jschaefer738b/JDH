Dear Dyer
We got back last night to
find poor Smith away, having been
sent for from Herrrogate -- or he might not
see his wife alive; serius effusion
having set in. I have however
made with Nicholson all arrangements
for tomorrow, & written to Smith that
he is not to hurry back, as I shall be
here all the week.
I wrote to you just before leaving


Edinburgh -- but had nothing particular
to say.
I am annoyed beyond measure at
Jenman's refusal to go with im Thurn
& indeed I am angry. What do you
think of my telegraphing to him
"go as guest" -- It would cost 48/
which I would gladly pay -- were I sure
that it would not hamper im Thurm
who has probably got another companion


ere this. What do you say?
I have written to im Thurm, but my
letter cannot go till the 17th.
money
I am also writing about the
to the R.S., Geog. Soc. & to Im Thurm's
brother. Is Tho. Foster going to Montreal?


Monday: I have just heard from
Smith. His wife has acute pain in
the side dropsy fainting & vomiting
the Doctors letter which is very
& cannot be moved. He sends me
alarming.
Bentham is back at Wilton Place,
& writes saying that he is overtired
by the journey, & that he is not so well
was 3 months ago.


I suppose you saw Watson's
beautiful & elaborate plan for the P.H.
What do you say to it  In respect of
the Guide--- it appears to me to be too
complicated for a wood-cut that would
require constant alterations.
