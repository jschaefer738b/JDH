good many genera of Orchideae,
Liparis, Erica & Dendrobium
amongst these -- & there are
some genera in which it is hard
to say whether the leaves are
when fully developed, coriaceous
or membranous, even where they
were obviously plicates & there is
variation. A genera was made
for the evergreen Beeches, but never
adopted; & the evergreen Oaks might
claim the same dignity.
As to my not having taken up
the name -- was it published when
I did the Orchids? -- I began in 1882
& finished in 1886, if I remember
aright
I am thirsting to know more
