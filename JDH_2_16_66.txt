Dear Dyer
I am sorry about the
contretemps with Birdwood,
though upon the whole perhaps


it is well not to push the
I.O. too far -- what were his
schemes? -- you must tell
me when I return. If we can


get on with Baddely without
asking for money so much the
better -- after all he must be


content to begin small if we
are to do with the money we
 have. As to Jackson, you must


my dear Dyer lead where you
cannot drive! & I fear that you
with I are in the same position that


I am with Smith -- we must get
off the Donkey & pull them along
now that we see how vast


the accumulations from India are
& what a time it must take, with
every
exertion, to clean them off
I cannot but think that closing
or even all
up one or two  Museums thoughout


the summer will be imperative.
Remember too the trouble we
shall have in supervising the 
building of No 1. -- & if No 2


building is to go on at the same
time that will add very much
of supervision
to our burthens . Rome was not


built in a day & whilst I cannot
too highly appreciate your zeal &
the astonishing amount of work


you have gone through, & the
energy you are prepared to throw
into the continuance of it all,
I cannot but feel that you may
overdo it. I am more accustomed


to the delays disappointments &c
that attend all great work under
indifferent masters than you are.


in the Navy &c


I had plenty of it during the first
five years of my Directorship -- I had
the same fights about alterations &
repairs, the same struggles to get


new buildings, additions to old,
staff for Gardens Herbarium & Library.
 & above all to get the increased
Happily I was well seconded by


Smith -- but or the other hand I had
far less consideration with the Board
than I now have. So my dear Dyer
do calm yourself "servate anonam
Aquarn"- & believe me, that though
all will not turn out exactly as


we wish, it will be better than you
expect.
You must give me more to do
when I return.  I quite & I warmly
appreciate your sparing me for


the Gen. Plant. & Flora B.I. but
when stress of work comes, such
things must give place to
less pleasant duties. Remember


too that unsatisfactory as much
of our labours are, the turn out of
satisfactory work as you show yourself
in the Report, is very great indeed,


I have written to Smith about
Martin & Sharpe
rearrangement of Sharpe's duties &c.
Have told him that the 
should free money to enable us
good
to get a man in Martin's place


who like Truelove could be
trusted to prune flowering--shrubs
& make & mend gravel paths & &c


without his (Smith's) supervision
 &c &c
As to Sharpe I told him that
I had had hints that the state


of No 4 might attract public
attention, that Sharpe was
(Smiths)
not realising his expectations,
that I did not see in his house
even the conmonest flowers


of the season that I saw in any
ordinary conservatory. I wonder
how he will take it all


I am still quite laid up.
having been worse again -- the
cough very troublesome indeed.
with weakness & loss of appetite.


I shall not wait longer than
over Sunday under any circumstances
for I am utterly sick of this
life of illness in another house.


with best love to Harriet &
all the good wishes of the seas
