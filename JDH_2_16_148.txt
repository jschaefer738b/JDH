SUNNINGDALE.

My dear Dyer
I have been long concocting
this letter to you about the Library
Catalogue -- you must deal with
it as you think fit; & let me
know if I can in any way assist
with your project.
Evans came up to me the
other day, about some scheme
for transferring a part of the
Kew cryptogamic collection to
the British Museum which he
had in his head -- I would
not enter into the matter with





him, & he said nothing -- but
I seriously hope that if any such
proposition is made that it will
not be entertained. The Kew
Herbarium is, as it stands, one
& indivisible, as the representation
in all Orders but the lower Algae, of
 the Botany of the Century; & is the work,
 for 80 years of it, of two individuals,
 & it further contains the evidences
two
of all that these hands published.
Probably, the Musci & algae
are what Evans had in view --
-- to rob the collection of which
would indeed be pulling up
