My dear Hemsley
I am sending f. Miss
Smiths drawings for dispatch to
the Paris Museums with which I
have a specimen of the little
Burmien Impatiens which I called
a new species but which I suspect
May be I. circaeoides tath the all of
which there are mutilated scraps
in Wallich's herbarium, which latter
I must reexamine
I have nearly finished the
Petersburgh bundle, a very heavy job
so many have had to be analyzed
to identify them. His of none
frightfully badly named all except


to set of Kewate's Ceylon species
A good many had been Lent to
Kew to be named with a very
bad result. Kew has sent also
a vey large proportion of the Roglean
distribution, including species not
in Herb. Hook
There are several Nepal species
new to me evidently from Lamberts
Herbarium which contained many
of Bud Hamelton plants -- They are
not in a state fit for description.
Is it known where Lamberts
Herbarium is ? Most oode of it
went abroad.
New is a beautiful small species


collected by Truithn in Sikkim
sent by Kew to St Petersburg of which
there is not a scrap in Herb. Kew.
There are 2 curious species from
Chitral - far west of the Indes
collected by Col. Gatteore on the
Chitral exped -- new to me.
I have a specimen of
Eria tekiling with monstrous
flowers found by my son Reginald
on the moor behind my house
