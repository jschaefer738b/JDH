My dear Dyer

Thanks for your letter
recieved yesterday.  Jackson has
not yet turned up. Simmonds tells
me that he is coming over probably
I have
to day with Holmes 
Cunliffe Owen about him, but
I do not think that will be of much
use! -- so I have been round the
principal Colonies & seen the lord
-
Keepers, who are most civil,
has
promise all they can. Simmonds
introduced me to them, & I have
asked them to attend to Jackson --
I still hope to see the latter, as
I think I should take him to


stem -- I suppose Alsophila Cooperi
35 ft long, & any number of small
things.
I have seen Brand's splendid collection
of woods, but really as to terms they are
not fit objects for such an exhibition
as this.  A selection would have
been far better.
I am here every day -- but my time has
been
3

taken up with official actings on
the Prince in the middle of the day
it  at the Embassy. He is very civil
sympathises with keeping Kew shut but
advises
a compromise, which I tell him
is impossible. I have not yet seen
half the exhibition & I have still the
Horticulture especially to look at which
cannot
I cannot shirck.
M. Pierre I have not caught yet
but hope to do so this afternoon.
keeps all his collections together &
wants Govt assistance to publish a
tam ap t Loxe -- in folio with drawings of


this &
300 plants. Decaisne tells me that he is
asteay to
unproductive, but that my may not mean
more than that Decaisne is so too.
The Fetes here(at
the Ministers

Versailles) have been
frightful fiascos
& we have shunned them, & spend
M.&
the evenings at Madam Regnals &
sheis
most nice persons. She is sister of Mrs
Symonds. -- last night we went to
the Hippodrome. & I must make out
a Theatre if I can.
I cannot give another day to the
Jardin des Plantes without waiting
over Sunday, which we shall do
the more as it will save us getting up
at 5 am to catch the Boulogne train at
7 -- the hour moves on to 9 on Monday,
which will bring us to Kew at 101/2pm
I suppose.
Reeve
I return proof of Bot. Mag. to Kew
today, Munro leaves to night via
Dieppe. he has found just nothing amongst
Grasses at the Jardin.
With best love to Harriet.
Ever affy yrs JosD Hooker
