My dear Dyer
Thanks many for your letter.
I am concerned to hear that you
too are laid up, an unwelcome
proof of sympathy! I have lost


shots


pains & aches except shots of
Rhumatics, but the Bronchitis is
very troublesome & I cannot show


my air tubes to the outside of
the House. I shall however return
on Monday next under any
circumstances as I am very anxious


to be back.
I am so glad that Hubble is
gone. It is quite absurd Smiths'
recent craze for giving every new


untried man the full salary of
the old & tried -- it is a sort of
extravagance too common to his


class, viz spending the money
because they have got it to spend.
I am writing to him about
Sharpe & Martin -- my detention
here is a good excuse. I almost


wish we had let Masters
explode in the Chronicle.
I quite believe that if we could
recorganise the Bot Garden formen,


we might do better to have such
a man as Watson supreme
foremen
head over all the others.  It will 
always be difficult to get men
& zeal to undertake such very
with sufficient knowledge activity 



small duties as the mere out of door
or the
gardening, & mere ornamental
department, under a head who is himself
requirements
not up to the scale & cannot see
horticultural
their deficiencies. Foremen really fit
to do the work are worthy of much


more extensive charges & naturally
ambitious as it is the Sharps &
Martins get more mare soil, pots


tools &c &c than they can usefully
employ, & no instruction as to how
to use them. -- I am quite sure
our expenditure on labour & material
might be reduced 1/4th by good  
management -- but reduce work as


you will, & plants too, the expenditure
goes on unabated.
the
On whole I am glad that Balfour


takes a man of his own choice: it
is but fair that he should, & it
saves us responsibility.
Please send any letters that you


think I can answer
last? I quite forgot to tell
Has Mr Currie (F.O.) answered my  


Smith to send him the box of
seeds for Cyprus -- Please see to
this, & that it is written outside
contents
what the are.


Best love & congratutations to
youself Harriet & the children
from us all -- the weather is
furious.


Ever aff yours 
JD Hooker
