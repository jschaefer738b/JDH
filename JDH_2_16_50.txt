Address -- Manse --
Largs
My dear Dyer
Mrs Hooker has written
begging us to stay at Largs for
a day or two after the funeral
Jame Campbell being so
perturbed that she is quite
anxious about him We
shall therefore go there this
afternoon -- but shall not
stay over Friday, if so long
It was Glasgow weather
on our arrival last night
but this morning is
that
Irequested
fine


Indeed we detested it,
but some -how old
associations cleave to
it, & well up in a curious
manner at many turns
Ever affy ys
JosD Hooker
