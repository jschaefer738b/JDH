SUNNINGDALE.
My dear Dyer
If you think that I can
be of any use I will gladly help:
reviewing the sheets of Icones, though
I must own that my eyes are
not so good as they were -- still
I may here & there spot a 
blunder so big that others have
overlooked it.
I would not trouble about
Reeve -- if there is any chance of
Dulam resenting it -- for I know
what good men Dulam are, &
how useful -- I do not see
