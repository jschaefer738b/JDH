THE CAMP.
SUNNINCDALE.
My dear Dyer
I shall be delighted to
have the Pisum in Bot. Mag. -- of
which I knew nothing till Mr
Burkill came to me about it
last Monday. I could get it
into the April number if Miss
Smith has drawn it.
I wrote to Rayleigh at once
pointing out that a site for the
Laboratory any where near the
Garden boundary, would ruin
one of the finest landscapes within
the fume distance of London, & be
an eye-sore for the Gardens for a


vey unequal lot.
If ever you care to see the book of
outlines of the pictures at Yarmouth
I will bring it to Kew.
Ever affy yrs
Jos. D. Hooker
