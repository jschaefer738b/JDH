My dear Dyer
I was sitting down to
write you some account of the
Association meeting on this my
only free day, when Charlie walked


in on his return from a fishing
excursion in Peebleshire, & as
my good hosts have asked him


to stop to dinner I must
amuse him till dinner time
& confine this epistle to a


few words, & the statement of
its enclosure - the payment for
Â£600 which please hand oer
to Mr Smith.


& successful one. -- Lubbock's address
The meeting is a very pleasant 
exceeded expectations & was
well received. The representation
here
of scientific men, is excellent
but Americans, & two literary or
but there are very few foreigners 
political men of note. G. Duff
notwithstanding. who by the way
looks miserable & absorbed & I
can hardly get an answer out
of him!


My section is dull flat stale
& unprofitable. Such geography is
not fit for representation at a
Scientific association -- I hae
have had to come down very
heavily on papers & talkers too.
Trelawney Saunders is as bad in


his way as the man at the L. U.
I regret to say that I cannot get
away till the 9 am train on Thursday.
These good people asked a party
before we arrived to visit us on


Wednesday night; they have been
vainly trying to coax their friend
to come another day instead, m
because I was so anxious to get
away on Wednesday afternoon -- so


I felt sund it would be unkind
not to stay.
We had a polemical sermon
at the Cathedral today from Bishop
of Manchester; a great mistake


for it was quite uncalled for -- no
one in any section having in any
way trodden on toes theological.
It was Eloquent & in a certain
sense able, but misjudged  &


hardy hardly charitable in tone.
Reynolds lecture on rain & hail
I thought wretched -- & by no
means correct as to statements


or conclusions as to fact.
I must break off with love
to Harrriet


Ever affy yrs
Jos D Hooker
