Tuesday


Dearest Harriet
I must write you a
few lines of congratulation -- &
most hearty they are, on Willy's
promotion, heightened as it is


by the perusal of Lord Iddesleigh's
letter. It is a matter of
Family rejoicing to find our
dear ones services so highly
appreciated as he has worked
hard for it, & though it was
only to be expected it is not the
least matter for congratulation
very
that it was justly to have paie
been expected. Long may


you both live to enjoy such
advantages
absguguents as it should secure,
& there are many & substantial
for ourselves & our children --
though not unmixed with
bitters. You will regret
leaving your pretty house, & so
did I thats now the Olivers --
but you will find this a
very charming residence taken for


all in all, & as a Government
one, it is exceptionally good, &
suitable to your income &
requirements & to have a Clerk of
the Works of one's own is an


unspeakable blessing!
I will bring my letter from Lord
Iddesleigh this evening


Ever heartily
Yr Aff father
Jos D. Hooker
