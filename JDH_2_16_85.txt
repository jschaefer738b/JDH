Dear Dyer
Many thanks for your letter
I am quite satisfied with the
result of the Fitzgerald "trial" our
men must see that they have


been fully supported by us &
the Board.
I enclose Mr Penrhyns answer
& shall write to Lord Lovelace.-- 


I will see to a better arrangement
in respect of the letters
probably they had better as before
all go to you.. I am sure that
Willy will not mind -- I was
rather anxious that he should


have some responsible duty.
Abel was here & at once
telegraphed to Smith & to
Woolwich: so I hope that Smith
found no difficulty. I sincerely


hope that we shall have the
Offices arranged for.
Lawson's address came off yesterday.
it won't do him any discredit.


& I can say no more:-- it was of
course very weak. I still hope
& expect that he will do for
Madras. The young Swede


shall be welcome, his discovery
of the rosette in Cycads is very
interesting -- where did he find
it? If I remember right it


has been found in Stigmana pisttels?
Thomson gave a most absurd
paper to the Geograph. section in the
"Evolution of the Lake Tanghynika",


more
founded on the supposed disposition
& structure
of the rocks than on any real
data. After his paper was read


T. Saunders got up & denounced
geological section -- In the
the paper as only fit for the 
interests of geography & especially of
the coming expediton to Kilimanjaro


I got up & combated Saunders
pointing out that such a paper
was eminently suited to the
Geograph section, though I could


not pretend to Entertain the
result
bold guesses on which the was
founded. I spoke much of the
imperfections of the Geolog. Record over


the whole Lake district - which
forced Thomson to have regard
primarily (or solely) to the physical
character of the rocks -- & wound
the necessity of
up with uriging collecting
supplying him with a naturalist
who might be the means of
throwing as much light on the 
over
later geological movements
Central Africa as the study of


the American Flora & Fauna had
on that continent & be the
connecting
means of convelets those of


South Africa will those of 
the N. hemisphere..
At Section D. Sclater & I took up 
the section.

me across the table if what I  
intended to do, I answered to
get it supplemented by private
& public means -- he asked if
I would aid it myself, I am
said yes -- when he immediately


wrote £10 on a slip of paper
& handed it to me as his
subscription. This I shall
contribution to a private 
follow up though I look to
more


the R. S. for substantial help.
I made much of Aitchison being
a volunteer. I mand must go


to Strachey about that. I think
that the Naturalist & staff must
be quite independent of the
Geograph. Staff & self supporting


& not push on beyond the first

good high collecting ground that 
begin with at any rate. -- Is it in
& establish himself there, to 
Zanzibar domains, if so would Sultan help?
I hardly know what to say
about the Forbes case. I doubt
the Council advocating two
expeditions -- I suppose however


that Sclater will manage that;-
.
if any body can he will.
I was much taken with Gamgee,

he is full of go & very sensible :


he strongly supported me
both in D. & General Committee.
I have now to see Scrivens
about it. -- Of 25 men on committee of
8 I knew 3 only at table!


Biology is literally no-where
at this meeting. I hope that
Mosely's lecture may redeem
it-- he has not turned up


yet. Ball is here.
We go to Netley this
afternoon & then on to Parkstone
The weather has been brutal

will stay over the whole time
there & then go to his friends


in Worcestershire for a few days.
Smith has the key of the
House -- which is shut up for 
the day -- Mrs Yeomans the
Coachman's wife sleeps in  it &


attends to Willy. I have told the
latter if he goes away for a day not
to fail to have the letters sent
to Smith's office for you to open --
I have another worrying letter
from Monier Williams to subscribe


to his Oxford India Institute.

I shall set to work at the
