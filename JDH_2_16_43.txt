My dear Dyer
Since writing last (from Dublin
think) we have been wandering
about rather vaguely, being very much
the slaves to the wether
We left Dublin on Wednesday for
Killarney -- ie Muckross where we
put up at O'Sullivans, clean, cheap
civil & noisy -- very plain food
& ordinary accommodation. The
Thursday it blew as furious a gale
as ever I saw at sea & rained
in torrents; but we made out
the Torc cascade at the expense of
a ducking, with Suringar, & a
Lupine geologist who turned up
at the Hotel -- Next day we
did the orthodox round -- of
Gap of Dunloe & down on the Lakes


by boat
next
and so back to Muckross
day, Saturday, weather gloomy &
a little rain at night & after
debating between Glengariff &
Cork decided on the latter, arriving
to
about midday. Took tram
Queenstown in afternoon & car to
Gumbletons -- found him in his
Garden; & after an enthusiastic
to see garden at
 hours went with him next
property, Mr Bagwell's (formerly M.P.
for somewhere in Tipperary) where I now
the
write. At Mr Bagwell's
ish
Ir
inevitable rivalry for our persons
took place & we settled it by
accepting Mr & Mrs Bagwells
invitation for two days beginning
Sunday mg & returning for the
night to Cork. At Cork I found
the Brady who went to Morocco
& Liversidge Prof of Geology at
Sydney N. S. W.


up
t


Gumbletons garden contains many
s
fome stanks & hirls, but - the
specimens are young & small. The
general character of this vegetation
you know from description -- nothing
can the exceed its luxuriance of
its kind -- but ony of its kind
a bachelor, a Bibliomaniac
Gumbleton is
to a certain point
& has heaps of expensive modern
China. his enthusiasm for plants
is only equalled by his ignorance. He
has not the remotest conception of
even Genus & species -- does not know
a Composite from a Grass or an Umbell
from either & I believe could not
comprehend it if pointed out. Nothing
can exceed his kindness & anxiety
to make as happy. He appears to be
regarded by the Bagwells as a son,
&they call him by his &tian name,
laugh at his eccentricities & ignorance
& praise his great goodness of heart,
charity & love of good works in the
neighbourhood.
To day  Tuesday Gimbleton will take


be





&
us to other Gardens about Cork.
r
tomorrow we return to Dublin
& so

see the Glassnevin & Powerscourt

 to Pendock on Friday or Saturday I hope.
In Cork we met the 2 Miss
Townsends with an Uncle who turned out
to be an Uncle of Gumbletons too!.
Miss T. is very anxious to hear from
Harriet to whom she sends her
love.
I fear that you can hardly read the
above pen & ink atrocious & no room
for my elbows
These Bagwells are very accomplished
& agreeable people. They rarely leave
Ireland now. Mr B. is an ardent
Horticulturalist with far better taste & Mrs
B. with more knowledge than Gumbleton
a great deal, Their gardens are most
lovely such a profusion of herbaceous
things in beds backed by shrubs, besides
glorious Fuchsias Escallonias etc.
With best love to Harriet from both
us & kindest regards to family.
Eer affection Yr
