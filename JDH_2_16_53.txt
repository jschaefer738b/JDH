I know that

I hope that my memo on Board's
letter concerning Wilkie will be
effective -- really Mitford seems to
be forgetting his work. Both
Hernt Potter & Lessels agreed that
it was impossible for the C of the W.

to have forgotten all about it!

Cooke's dealing in Fungi must
not disturb us. If he is to have
3 days a week he may do what
he likes in them. I quite agree with
all you say on that head.

I do suppose they are identical

Succulent House for them. Binder
says that the Australian plants
have gone back since they left
the Octagon, & Smith backs him,
on account of the irrepressible drip

I hope you will enjoy your Sunday
out, kindest regards to the Brightwens.
From yours just arrived -- I quite 
approve the letter about Taylor
going. You must sign it.  I think it
would be misinterpreted if I did so.
I think it should be headed "Neglect
of Orders", & I think it would strengthen
it if you added a passage saying that your
main object in writing was to show how
little idea the C of W. Dept had of the
serious nature of the Evil, & of the anxiety &
worry it gave to the Officer, Y yourself & Smith who
cannot stand it. J.
