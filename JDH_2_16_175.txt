THE CAMP.
SUNNINCDALE.
My dear Dyer
I am really obliged for
your note about Plagius grandiflorus.
The plant puzzled me, & I lost
a good deal of time over it.; for
it does not agree with De Candolle's
description. I am sending for
fresh specimens for Bot. Mag.
I was very much impressed
with the Coronation affair. We left
we
the house were staying at, at about
8 &, were set down at the Abbey at
9.30, we had front seats in the
nave, where the G.C.s were located


902


the procession passing us at little
more than hand-shake distance:
but the weather was so gloomy &
the windows of the abbey so blocked,
that the diamonds did not sparkle.
The variety of costumes was very
striking, their gorgeousness was depressing --
The Lords Peers' coronets the most hideous
head-gear conceivable. & the caps
of maintenance little better, the crowns
were very becoming -- though the jewels
did not scintillate, for want of light
of course we saw nothing of the ceremony,
the "Theatre" being crammed with
the nobility &c &c The cheering was both
hearty and solemn:- vy effective. My
blue mantle was a horrid nuisance,






Thanks very for information
about Gelsemiums -- Bot. Mag. is a
man-trap & I feel it on both ankles.
