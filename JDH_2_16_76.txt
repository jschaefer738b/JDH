Venice April 28/81


My dear Dyer
I am very much concerned
to hear that you have again been
unwell, & with ague -- brought on


I suppose by the miserably cold
weather that you have had. I
sincerely hope that it is nothing serious
& that you will not hesitate to 


send for me if it should be at
our way home: we leave this
all advisable.  We are now on 
on Monday by which time we
shall have seen most of the
in Venice
prinicipal sights, we shall go 
straight to Milan, & thence
according to our "Cook's tickets" by 


the Lakes over the St Gotthard (if
open, as I believe it is) to Zurich
& so to Paris. A letter would


catch me at Zurich (Monte
Ventrule). Thence, after seeing 
St
Heer, to Paris. Hotel Romaino


Rue St. Roch.
I am very sick of church seeing &
Madonnas -- but was very glad to
visit Venice again & test my former


experience of the effect of its
school of art on my mind. I am
more impressed than ever with 
the grandness of the Venation school
nothing comes up to my admiration
as well as with the coloring & 


of it as a whole. No where is the
power of pictoral art conveyed 
so visibly to my mind as in the
Academy here, & I still think 


Titians assumption & Presentation
the most magnificent pictures
I ever saw.
From Florence we visited Sciena  


with the Miss Horners & Anne Perry &
there met two of the Miss Cobdens
who asked much for Harriet, (they
were not her companions in Algeria
however). On our way hither from
Florence we visited Bologia, &
took a siding to Ravenna, a


town of extraordinary interest. I
was amazed to find the famous
Pine Forest (P. pinea) killed 
dead, by the cold of 1879 -- 80! & 


past recovery; young & old all
killed -- I never saw anything like
it except the great eucalyptus
Forest of the subalpine plateau of
where
Tasmania which I rode through
apparently


20 miles of dead taller
timber, killed in 1835.
If I have time in Paris I
should like to take a day & roam
down to Hortes Segregianus, but 



vegetation is so backward that I fear  
I shall be too early to find it 
in a good state.


The weather has been fair on the 
fires here in the evening! The Grays
whole, but always cold, & we have 
are well, but I think that Dr. G. is
rather tired of sight seeing; Mrs
Gray's appetite for pictures & Churches


is insatiable, & she has very good
Judgement & a thorough love of act.
(Her brother is keeper of the Art Museum,
at Boston)


I need hardly add that if I am at all
wanted I do hope you will telegraph to
Milan, which we cannot leave till Tuesday


With much love to Harriet from
Lady H's best regards to yourself. 
us both & to the children, & 
Yours affy 
JD Hooker
