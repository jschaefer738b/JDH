Dear Dyer
More last words
I After I had written to Ferguson
Lady H brought me the C.O.
from the Drawing room. I can
truly suppose that I took it up
to show Sir W. I. Elphinstone or
some of the Cingalese with
whom we have been infested
of late. -- Perhaps my letter
may still go, as I have added
a P.S. to say the paper is
found.
II. I have written to Palgrave


V.


it is not to be wondered at.
Also that a visitor was seen to
thrust his stick into the rotten
beam of the Fern House. See what
I have said & forward it or take it in.
I have no time to answer the
letter about Taylor & Willkie,
but have indicated my
views. You can formulate
them please
VI. I am puzzled about writing
to Oliver. He may take offence
the plants
at my not commnicating  through
his own officer Baker -- If I
ask him to go over to you &
he goes & finds you in town
he will be offended. If l ask
him to make an appt with
you it may be taken the





wrong way! Just see what
I have said, & act as you think
best -- You may destroy the
letter of you like & leave the
plants till I return, except
A Grays by the way. which he will.
is expecting I think.
Ever affy yrs
JDHooker.
