Dear Dyer
Thanks for your two
letters & enclosures.
Lessells action is a pure piece


of Mischief making -- I never expected
or wished to see Fergusson's plan
of the Vestibule; what I did
& do blame Lessells for is, his
authorizing the contractors to proceed
with it without informing me.


I never directly or indirectly
or used his name.
alluded to & Fergusson in the
matter. It is most amazing that
we should be subjected to such
a mans insolence.
I am now writing to F. about


the steps & access to the Verandah
which will I am sure prove a
there will be attraction
nuisance --
enough inside the building,
& at any rate I think we should


wait & see how we can
manage the inside before
attracting people to the outlide.
or a lounge.
Lesseles promised me that


nothing should be done about
the water until the papers were
submitted to me & expressed
himself hotly against giving any


water at all. As you say the
Treasury has made a complete
mess of
the whole affair.


We have had a pleasant stay
at Barton, always an interesting
house, & here -- a fine old place
representing the accumulated property


of various heiresses. My host, a
man of great intelligence has been
initiating me into the mysteries
of drain pipes, cess pools & the


like: he is a liberal animated
enlightened man amongst a
neighborhood sunk in Torydom
the Secpect due. The Agricultural


&


interest here is "burnt up". The
"families" have, almost to a man
left let their houses to the millionaires
of trade & are in hiding, on


retirement. -- The effect will be
a partial return when the seasons
may come that will bless their
fervour, but in many cases an


abandonment of the land & then
funding the proceeds of its sale.


I hope that you have good news
of Harriet. -- We return tomorrow
by the afternoon train from Norwich.
Ever affecely yurs


Jos D Hooker
