We go on the 2d to Bournemouth,
weather permitting.
Thanks for the hints about
strychnine & iron -- I had the
former but was obliged to give it
up. I really want nothing now
but will tell my Dr  what you
say. I have followed your advice
as to Port wine.
I congratulate Harriet on the
Cat's recvey -- love to her

Ev affy

The enclosed should I think be
with the Treub papers.
