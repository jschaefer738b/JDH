Ceylon species are concerned, supported
his work: -- but this does not go
very far.
My orchideae all want to be
done over again, the additions of
species by King & Ridley are so
many & my own supplements so
large, & corrections so many.
I have written to ask King
whether & at what cost he could
get copies of all the later Cal

Orchids
Garden & ones supplied for Kew.
It would be well that he should
 publish them in a Vol. of the Annals;
but they would not be coloured:
he might however get a copy
coloured for Kew.
Ever afly yrs
