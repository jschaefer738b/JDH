My dear Dyer
I think it is settled that
we shall try Skye, the we
including Mrs Lyell Ruamond
& Arthur, Mr Symonds*2 & Miss
Turner - & then my wife &d
will proceed to Aviemore &
after a few days with the
Grants, turn south & home
via the Coleviles near
Dunfermline. We are quite
overwhelmed with invitations
& have made a perfect
holocaust of them.
The feature of the Association
has been Tait's Lecture on Force


which consisted of an aggravated
assault on Tyndall, most 
able, most humorous, most
cruel & simply execrable in
tone gesture & matter. It has
greatly disgusted his friends,
especially poor Andrews who
insisted on Tait lecturing, &
Sir W. Thomson who has
twice spoken to me about
it with great concern
Andrew's address I thought
very poor. Wallace's excellent,
Evan's & Merrifield's both good
but Newtons miserable.
The absence of familiar faces


at the Association is quite
remarkable.
I hope to report favourably
on your application by tomorr
but objects were raised
in the Committee on the grounds
that according to the wording
the application should have
come from the Linnean.
I forward Newton's letter
& shall act (with Bentham)
accordingly. I could not
last
get to the Committee of
Recommendations, but
shall I hope to the next.
The distances here are so
enormous, that one can






hardly do anything in town
& at the Association in the
same day.
Ever mostsincerely yours

Jos. D. Hooker
