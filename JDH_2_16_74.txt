Naples March 30/
81.


My dear Dyer
I am writing to Mr Smith
asking him to send to Mr Romaine
a nice set of Green house &c things


& have given him the address. As Mr R.
was of very great service to us as Sec. of
the Admiralty. Mr Smith will I am


sure treat him as well as we can
afford -- as he always does in short.
Willy has forwarded me the enclosed
from Sir Wyville Thomson. He does not
say whether he informed Sir W of my


absence, or whether you have seen
it. -- I should not like to answer
it without a reference to former
acknowledging, or
correspondence:- Pray use your
Judgement in respect of answering


it for me or leaving it till I
return. Your diplomacy has
evidently subdued him!


We are having a change of weather
with the Equinoctials, which manifest
themselves in slight showers, wind,
& a warmer temperature in fits &


starts.
Since writing last we have been to
Amalfi, Sorrento, Paestum & up
Vesuvius, besides paying more visits
to Dohm's Aquarium & the Museum


here. I shall write to Mr Symonds
next & ask him to forward the
general features of the
letter to you. Neither the country nor
the climate improve on acquaintance
but the extraordinary interest of
the localities never fails, & is indeed
rather fatiguing from its abundance
& variety.-- I quite dread Rome


where we go tomorrow for a week or
10 days. Address Maquai Hooker &c
C of Bankers.
I wrote to you last from Castellammare
on or about the 23rd & to Willy on the


28th
From Rome we go to Florence where
again Maquai Hooker &Co are the
Bankers who honor my bills on


Barings.
I hope that all goes well at Kew
excuse more at present, as I have
lots of small letters to write & with
love to Harriet & the Children


I am ever affy yours
JD Hooker
