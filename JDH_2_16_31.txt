Dear Dyer
Thanks for your letter. I
cannot tell you how vexed
I am about the cheque & the
trouble you have had.
I am distressed about the theft
of Bain's portrait, it certainly
points to persons who have
personal
an interest in the man.
Reeve never sent me over the
magazine proofs, for which he
had abundant time &
which he faithfully promised.
The descriptions must be
delayed till next month now
