My dear Dyer
We have just arrived
from Loch Lomond, & found your
3 letters & enclosures -- very many
thanks for all the trouble you
have taken.
I return the two India Office
drafts signed herewith, also
Backhouse's*2 letter which I am
particularly glad to have
seen, as he is a punctiliously
conscientious man & not
given to overpraising!
I must confess however that
all that is done is not half


that should be done, in the
especially
Arboretum
Strachey is I suppose back
in London now, he was to
be at Aviemore last week.
I hope that what we wrote
about Mr Talbot is the right
thing. I puzzled good deal
over it & thought much over
it since, but to no further
avail. I am most anxious
to stand well with the I.O.
Thenls for what you have
done about Eaton. I had
quite forgotten Lyallia which
should of course be figured
& the aen Uncinia.
I dare say that the Calcutta


Garden is very bad indeed.
I do not see how it can be
considering
otherwise under the depressing
conditions it exists under: but
Mudel is a disagreeable conceited
Jackanapes & wants a setting
down himself.
I wrote to Duthie that he
must take Thwaites opinion
as to the destination of the
rubbers which he takes out,
& that opinion must depend
on the state of the plants on
their arrival, and on those of
 the 40 cases sent to Ceylon
-if the 40 cases have
arrived in fair order, then
or all
some of th Duthie's if in good
order or if the 40 contents of the





40 cases Duthie's are in bad
order, should go on to Calcutta
to be sent at once to Assam.
I am delighted to hear
of the Dipterocarp application
& shall strongly back it: & all
the more as I am so anxious
about your coming forward for
R. S. though with Bentley stopping
not
the way it could be as unanimous
a matter as I should wish.
I have heard nothing of the
Association as yet -- Bentham is
gone to the general meeting.
We have had tolerable weather
for our trip to the Clyde, Inverary,
Loch Lomond, -- fine on the
whole, with tremendous squales


i.e. with several duckings!
324
I have
of wind & rain
interested in
been much
my old
visiting
haunts some of which are
unchanged & others unrecogni
=sable. We have not met
a single fr tourist friend till
one of
today when 2 Miss Coles Whom
I had met at Miss Sullivan's
turned up on board the
Loch Lomond Steamer --
Mrs Hooker is an excellent
traveler, climbs & walks like
a mountaineer, & is indifferent
to bad weather.
Please say everything from me
to Mr Smith
& believe me ever
sincerely yours
Jos D Hooker
