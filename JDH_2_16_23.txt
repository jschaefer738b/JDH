Dear Dyer
Will you be so kind as to
look at the enclosed letter for
the Trustees BM. & show it to
Mr Bentham. Giving me an
opinion (which I know will
be candid).
I showed Oliver a much
longer one, of which this is a
condensation.  He did not
approve, & suggested what
accompanies it on a sep
slip in his handwriting.


confidentially, & send one to
the Archbishop of Canterbury
semi-officially, asking him
to take look into the
matter to avoid a serious
disturbance of the peace.
Oliver does not consider
that as an official Trustee
I am responsible to the
R. S. & that I ought to
disarm the Trustees.
I must confess that their
ingratitude touches me
more than anything else
but this is "small" in me
I own.


The enclosed Magnolia is
called fuscata in MacLeay's
Greenhouse, but the flower
is far smaller & the bud
differently shaped from
ours.
