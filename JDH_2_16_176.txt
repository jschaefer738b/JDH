My dear Dyer
Thank you for your letter -- I
heard from Willy of your return in
good health.  Also of poor Harriet's
influenza, which must be a trial to
you in which we do sympathise -- I
wrote her my Xmas greetings. If you
were late in taking your holiday we
are later -- & it remains to be seen
how the weather able will favour us.
Matte had been a good deal pulled
down & heard of this air being bracing
so we have determined to try it for a
month. Except for 6 days when we
went to Hereford & Oakwood we
have been at home all the year. When
place
at the latter we drove over to see your









good collector & systematist, I suppose
all that remains to be done is to
acquaint the Agent General with our
views, Will you do so please?
This is a queer place -- miles & miles
of red brick houses of all sizes often in
gigantic terraces & blocks 5--6 stories high
with hideous blank interspaces of grass &
rubbish -- a sea without shore or ships,
land without trees -- architecture
uniformly vile -- where all the people come
from to inhabit the legions of big houses is
a mystery to me -- the whole place is
only half baked to look at -- the shops
are excellent, & air splendid.
With best love to Frances in which
Lady Hooker joins, & with the requests
that she will let us know in a few
days how her Mother goes on.
Evr affy ys
Jos. D. Hooker
