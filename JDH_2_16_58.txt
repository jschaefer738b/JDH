Dear Dyer
I received your despatch
after this forenoon at Dunferm
line.
I am very glad that you
have answered Mitfords letter
so well. It is useless hoping to
disentangle him from Lessells.
Yours (herewith returned) of
Aug 22 in which you speak
well of the energy & resource of
Boards officers must have
crossed his, & will show him
that you are not down on
the Works Dept where they
deserve praise.


When next I see him I shall
tell him (for the hundredth time
that I shall never be satisfied
till the Glass houses are repaired &c
by Horticutural builders, & the
machinery is put under competent
engineers, nor then till either
& their subordinates
Wilkes or Taylor are replaced b
y
by efficient men.
The worst of it is, in the last mentioned
matter I am stranded by Smith.
On my return I will take the

Lessells when we required him) &

We have been nowhere.
