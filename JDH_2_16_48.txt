Dear Dyer
We have just heard
to il
that Willielma died very
suddenly & without suffering,
& the letter (from Isabella) is so
confused that we cannot
gather from what cause
indeed none is mentioned.
She had quite time to
see her husband & bid him
good bye, & to leave a message
her brot mother who
was not sleeping in the
house. She is to be buried


at the Glasgow necropolis,
near the High Church -- an
enormous way from our house.
We go down on Monday
at about 111 & shall stay
at the Royal Hotel,
George's Square.
Ev affey
