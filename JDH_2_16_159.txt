My dear Dyer
I have taken the opinions of
Mr Rising of Yarmouth, & of Mr
F. Symonds of Hereford & both say
that sons & son's in law are quite
competent to be Trustees in the
present case. notwithstanding
being beneficiaries. I shall
therefore, having your permission
add Willy's & Charlie's names.
I went to see Capt
Oliver at Findon yesterday
10 miles off, in a very pretty spot
on the Downs. -- he has a
wonderfull collection of sketches
