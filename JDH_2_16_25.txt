much the other way.
I shall certainly remonstrate
with Allman about sending
his paper to the Royal: what
will be regarded as a snub
to the Linnean. Though I am
sure he does not intend it
as such. Bentham may not
quite like the idea of turning
the Council Room into a
meeting room. but I am quite
sure he will not oppose it,
or be "dis-pleased". Let Allman

Council; & I hope that the

I am so vexed with
myself for having disheartened
you the other night, & am
myself much concerned that I


should have left you under
"impression that my "sympathies

"side of Botany" -- I am quite at
a loss to think what I said to
lead you to think ths-&
whatever it was, I exceedingly
regret it. Our conversation was
a mixed & muddled one, personal
in two respects & general in many
more. Personally I felt for
myself, that I was committed
in the matter of the Cape Flora.
Personally I felt for you, that
your acquirements & powers
are being expended on labors
that do not tend to give you
that scientific position to which
you are so well entitled: and
as regards us both,
 personally, I felt that I had
individually profited
by
your




& eminently wise ones. My warm
participation in them surely
showed no want of sympathy
with Biology as opposed to System
Had you declined the systematic
work & come forward to devote
your attention to pure physiology
at Kew, I hope & believe you
would have found me as
sympathetic -- Assuredly I should
have as strongly lifted up my
voice against your devotion
of so much time & labor to
both
to what is unremunerative with
pecuniarily & in point of
position, & as I think productively too.
With regard to the British
Association, I feel acutely that
I should not have alluded

to it -- though I did it

I should abandon it to younger
hands. If the Linnean offered
me no more advantages than
the B.A. I should equally
abandon it. True the disinterested
desinterested motives (of which I
hope I am not void) that inspire
me to keep either, are the
same in kind, but altogether
different in degree. The Linnean
well worked, is an unmixed good,
not so the Brit Assn.
I intend to arrange this coming

the Ro Chair to

as to attend the Linnean:-
for obvious reasons I could
not do this last winter.
Your notion of rallying the
Biological side of Zoology to the
Linnean is advocated strongly in one
