My dear Dyer
I received your wellcome
of July 13
letter at Denvers two days ago --
it had arrived after me all round
Colorado. I need not say I am
most glad to hear of your being
settled & not altogether overwhelmed
with the duties, though for the
present they must be very hard
& trying. Mrs Hodgson most
kindly wrote me a little account
of her visit to you & Harriet -
which made me very glad.
As for me I never worked
harder in my life -- there is so
the incessant
much to learn
collecting & packing
travelling adds enormously to
the drudgery.
I am verypleased



to have picked up the knowledge
have of the
I already
trees & especially of the Pines
of Colorado & hope before I get
back to have such a knowledge
of the habits & habitats of the
Western Conifers as no one else
has. The association of so
many species is a feature
quite new to me, & such as
exists no where else. To find 8
or 10 Conifers on one Mt. is a
marvellous feature in vegetation.
Thus in Colorado we have between
5 &10000 ft -- Pinus edulis, ponderosa,
aristata & flexilis Abies Douglasii
Menziesii & Engelmannii (varieties of
one) -- Picea concolor & Juniperus
virginiana, occidentalis & communis,
all abundant. Of these except &
two of the Junipers none are found
