Brewery at Halesworth which he was
(& disinclined!)
totally unfitted to manage, led to the
a great part of
dissipation of the fine property which he
inherited; to which must be added a
rather reckless expenditure in travelling,
London society, & the purchase of books on
Ornithology, Entomology, Botany &c. &c. &c & on
the British Jungermanniae, Muscologia, &c.
With love to Harriet & the children if

I should be glad of some hardy
perennials, Asters &c when the beds are
being sorted -- do not trouble about Nama-
I cannot keep them, my soil is so light -
that they have no hold.
We return to the Camp on Monday.
