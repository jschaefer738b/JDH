My dear Dyer
I will do Mueller
before long & I have just sent
off Hodgson.  These Society
obituarys are becoming a tax, or
rather have been thid to me, but
I am nearly at the end of my tether!
I am having a lot of
correspondence about Banks.
Mr Ings has sent me some
letters of Solander Cunningham &
Anderson which I shall give to
Herbm.
It is good news that you


will undertake Finances for the
R.S. I feared it might go into
Brittens' hands.  I have been
poring over the vols of Ceylon
Flora & trying my hand at some
of the genera -- Carex and Fimbristylis
with Clarkes work, & find it
necessary with the latter to fall
back on Bentham a good deal.
As you told me, I find that it
will take 2 vols to finish the
work.  If I undertake it I must
think about it for a couple of
years.  It will be drudgery &
the Govt. must gild the pill.
I have just heard from King
