Rome
Hotel Italia.
March 10/81.


Dearist Harriet & William,
As the seeing Rome is an
event in one's life, I think I must
celebrate my arrival here by writing


to you though I have seen nothing
as yet, but walls, ruins & a lovely
view from the Pincian hill (on which


our Hotel is situated). My first observ--
vatiion is on the climate, it is horrid
& a brilliant sky & sun & a wind that
both stings & powders with dust. Deceived


by the glare of the sun I went out before
breakfast without a coat, & am now
sneezing in consequence. However I have


as yet nothing worth telling you about
Rome, & so shall work back a little
in our Journay. We spent 4 days in
Paris, dining on Monday with the Levalier


a very gentlemenly agreeable & apparently
wealtly man.
We were
even persuaded into
staying over the
Tuesday to dine with Mr. Copin, who


was alone, his wife, & family being in
the country & I am sorry to say we were
most dreadfully bored. What can have
possessed him to ask 2 ladies to a
attempt of any kind was made to
a bachelor's party, during which   no
entertain
entertain them! & as to ourselves he
simply praised away till we were
rich Herbarium -- which he says he will
tired. He has a fine house & a very
leave
ours in fact, it
to a grandson if the latter takes to
Botany, if not it is to be offered to the
Govent. for fr 500,000, & if they wont purchae
free
it is to go as a par gift to Kew. It is
very rich in European & Orentatal plants
including all Bunge's.


From Paris we went to Chambery &
next day to Turin, where we saw the
Champollion collection of Eygptian Antiquities
which is very fine.


had packed up my "Morren" & did not
remember that Archangeli was Professor
or I should have called on him.
From Turin To Genoa where we stopped 3


nights we called at once on the Marquis
Doria to whom both Ball & Beccari had
written, informing him of our arrival.
us


The servant told he was at the Municipal
Chambers, & we left cards & addresses,
but he did not return our call! We
saw the Dorie Murum of Nat. Hist.
in which the Mammals & Birds of the
Malay Islands are splendid. We called


on Delpino, who is a shrivelled up
Italian, & seemed afraid of the Ladies
most
-- he was polite in his offers of civility,
but rather glad when our backs were 


turned we thought. We revisited the
Old Palaces that I saw in 1874 & when the
Van Dykes are splendid beyond conception.
The Bot. Gardens are small & miserable,
here
there is a very interesting "Alpine
Club" house, conmanding a superb view
sketches of
& pretty alpine scenery. From it you have a


a grand view of the Alps from Monte Rosa
to Monte Visa.
From Genoa we took the train to Pisa,
arriving in time to take one view of the
Duomo, which is to my mind the most
satisfactory Italian Cathedral I know, the
lines of the interior are most beautiful


& the pink decorations quite in keeping
throughout. The Cathedral Baptistry &
town all stand in an open area,  &
the effect by moonlight is delicious (but
it was awfully cold) -- Next morning early
we revisited it & spent all the time
we could in the Campo Santo; where the


wonderful frescos deserve any amount of
study. We left by the Train at 11 am
meeting Betsy White (that was) at the
station -- she seemed so glad to see us
but looked wretchedly pale thin & with
face discolored red & white that I
did not know her -- pray say nothing of
this at Kew, as it would grieve her
parents so if it came to their ears --
she said she was very well & her baby
too, & asked warmly  for you all


From Pisa we came on here along the
Coast line which is flat throughout &
often marshy -- a most thinly populated
though widely cultivated counity -- I
was very much struck with the absence of
all the way
rivers or even streams, between the
Arno & the Tiber. It looked as if the


county had been recently raised from
the sea, & that the waters had not had
time to collect themselves into definite
yet there were hills all along to the east.
cold moonlight, & leave tomorrow
channels. We arrived  by bright
for Castellamare. Hotel Qui-si-sana -


where we shall be off & on for a
fortnight doing Naples & all the
neighbourhood from thence -- we shall
return to Rome by the 4th April, before


which I shall write again. We have
just caught Miss (Mary) Symonds & her
brother here, they leave tomorrow for
the North.


I am very much struck with the
scantyness of the population in all central
Italy that we traversed -- we could see
very small & very scattered villagers villagers in the


hills far back from the plains, & it is
evident that the peasants must come
a long way to their work every day.
We are fortunate in travelling before the
foliage is on the trees which this
flat country would impede the
view along the plains. Of wild


flowers we have seen few but
purple anemones & violets & not
many of these. Not a tree is even in
bird bud yet! -- One curious feature
is the whiteness of the backs of almost


all the trees S. of the Alps, Planes
Poplars, Mulberries & Elms.
All
with best love to the children -- Please


let Willy know, & thank him for his
letter & enclosure of 11th just received.
Address till end of month.
Holel Quisisana, Castellamare
Pro. de Naples.

Ever your most affectionate father

Mr Beccari has written wishing to
meet us at Rome -- if you see Mr.
Ball please tell him    this.
