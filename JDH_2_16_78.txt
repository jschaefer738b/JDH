Dear Dyer
I think I had best send
you the enclosed & you can tell
me what you would like done;


whether you will act,  or debate
Vines, or what.--
It is all straight sailing here
The Madras mattings have come, & I
have given the list to Jackson.
I have sent a box of nice things
to Regel.


Treub announces the arrival of his
case in very good order, & is sending
it back with, amongst other things
Dischidia Rafflesiana & Kaulfussia.
The things from Nancy are arrived
Morris writes, as usual, in excellent spirits


announcing safe arrival of 2 Wardian
cases in good condition, & is delighted
with growlh of Landolphia's in Jamaica.
Warming is sending dried Cycad leaves


for you
Cameron sending C. circinalis from
Jungles of Deccan.


Kirk is sending a box of bulbs
Arenga saccharifera arrived in
Bahamas in perfect order, only
one dead


Athens Consul is sending Salvia
Apples from Heldreich & a footstool
of stems of Ferula communis!
Alf. Wallace is sending a few sprats
to catch mackerel in shape of more
herbacious plants.


The C.O. wanted me to undertake the
providing outfits for the Jamaica
men & sending bills to them. I
declined & they have paid over Â£30





each to the two youngsters.
King's cases have arrived in wretched
state. I find but one plant
worth having, Magnolia sphenocarpa:
Espeut sends a long yarn & is sending in


50 lbs of dried Bananas wanting us
to recommend them!
Trimen sends 12 pages of a screed, but
there is little in it beyond a wail
Clarke
over Haggalle, Cameron being extremely


ill with Typhus, as is a Cingalase sent
up to take his place
Horne's book is out, he has sent you
a copy.
Poor Currey is dead, & was buried


yesterday -- he died suddenly &
has left his Fungi to Kew.
With love to Harriet
