My dear Dyer --
I am indeed sorry to hear
of your cold & cannot think the
office a place to be cured in. I propose
feeling my way with him. I wish
seeing Mitford as soon as I return &
I could see any more likely plan for
Offices than the Directors House. My
first object will be to overthrow
the Palace as an office
Yes Smith's hand is as firm as of


Yore, & I remarked the improvement
before he left. I do believe
however that he acknowledges
that his position & duties are
not what they were, any more
than his strength & energy
He promised me, that the spent
mould of the Houses, should all


go to the Arboretum & first of all
starving Horse chesnuts. I took
to the sunk ground at the
him there myself-- & he said he
would have it done at once
The weather here is wretched
& I have been out but once. I
shall be glad to get back, though
they are so kind.
With united love to
Ever affy yrs
Harriet and kindest regards to you
J D Hooker
