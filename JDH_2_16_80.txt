Dear Dyer
Your packet & welcome letter
arrived today, via Nash Mills,
to which you had inadvertently
redirected it. It was accompanied by
a letter from Evans, repeating the
kind message regarding Charlie.
The enclosure from the Board in re
Steudel upset me: that such

is disheartening, & I am puzzled how
to answer it. My first thoughts were
to suggest a rereading of the letter,
but on second thoughts I have kept
the letter for calmer moments. I do
not remember ever to have had a
worse time with the Board -- it is a
long lane that has no turning & we


must just be patient.
I quite agree as to the requirements of
the Cryptogamic Department, but we
must take care lest by making our


wants too urgent we may not suggest
to the Board
the division of labour with the B.M.
If such an idea was to suggest itself to
a man like Lefever, he would attempt
to carry it, through. Let the B.M. appear

to the "concurrence"; or the F.C. made
him write the minute. Lefever is
ignorant enough for anything, &
Mitford should know better.

It is difficult to believe that he has

Thanks for forwarding the Gas Cy receipt
which was for a call, I tremble for the
consequences!
