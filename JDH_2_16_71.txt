Dear Dyer
I forward the Herbarium donations
done as well as I can without means
of reference, it will require your critical


eye & Olivers revision. If you think I
have said too much of Munro, pray
cut out: but I think it well that the
Kew Report, now that it has assumed


such important dimensions, should
be a botanical recorder of such
Eminent service as he rendered to
Botany.


I wish I had brought a copy of the
last Report which I intended to do, &
I would have worked up the Kew


publications. If you will forward me a
copy to
I will try my hand at it,
By right the Report should not be
later than March 31. but that will be


impossible this year.
On Sunday Gray & I called on Decaisne
who we found looking aged, he
suffers terribly from attacks of gravel


on the kendneys. He tells us he has a
pupil who has discovered that the
hairs form the most important
diagnostic character of the Nat. Ords
that it is infallible! Of course we did
not contradict him -- he himself is
finding characters of species of Clematis


in the number of woody bristles of the
stem  & in the cellular tissue of the
testa of the seed! I fear that
Baillon will come down on all this
We spent the qreater part of Monday


at the Jardin -- where I found about
of Madagascar
18 Palms, but not in a state fit for
description -- We also called on
Cornu & Van Tieghem & saw both


the latter complains of the small
volume in Science that all his teaching
leads to.
Yesterday we dined at Lavalier's in a


beautiful House, quite palatial. We
met Duchartre & Chatin, both very
agreeable - & today we have been
to St Denis & we leave tomorrow
for Chambery. -- then Turin. Then


Genoa, Pisa & so to Rome (for one
night) & on to Naples.
with love to Harriet


I am aff ys
