The Camp
Sunningdale 
Feby 23rd/86


Dear Dyer
I had hoped to be
at the Herbm. almost every
day this week, but I have
caught a cold that will
certainly not allow me to
get up till Saturday.


I hope that all is going
on well in the Garden & with
the Board, & that your pay is
all arranged. I am reading
Froude's Oceana, which to me
is very interesting. He is crazy


about the Australian Gardens
which should give them a
fillip[?]. Please send me



Mr Harcourt's letter, I should
acknowledge his civilities
personally. When do you
expect Morris? 
I have a letter from 
A. Gray, but it contains no news
except that he has begun on
Ranunculaceae for the American


Flora. -- the Thalamiflorae should
not cost him much trouble.
Please give enclosed to
Oliver to arrange
with love to Harriet
