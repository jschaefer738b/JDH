Dear Dyer
I find that the
Hodgsons have asked some
people to come here & meet
me on Saturday, so that I


can't leave till Monday
I forget whether I signed
a cheque for this coming
Saturday -- if not & you
will kindly send me one I
will do so.
I find H. very much
changed; his memory quite
fluid -- & he has rather
a troublesome cough: also


his knee troubles him.
He talks of Mentone for
the winter.
The train brought on my
ear--ache again. But after
a very bad night it is
better to day.


Ever affy yrs
JDHooker
Love to Harriet we were
delighted to find her so bright.
