Hotel Romain
Rue St Rock

Sunday


Herbarium. If you approve, please
look to the few blanks. The list
shows a wonderful amount of Botanical
query & activity on the systematic &
descriptive lines. Should not
Bentham's name be mentioned I
forget whether we have done so
in former cases & I stupidly forget to
bring a copy of the Report with me.
I am now doing the additions to


My dear Dyer
I send the list of visitors to


Herbarium & have made a
screed apropos of the Schimper &
Munro Herbs with a little eloge
of the latter -- which I hope you
will approve; you may word it
 better I think here & there.


I have thought a good deal over your
going to Court -- & am convinced that
your prime motive, the establishment
is the best, & to this I ought to
contribute especially considering that
I got my swell suit for nothing.


I think however that there is another
motive, for that though not compulsory
& yes it is due to yourself & to your
position -- in respect of the latter it is


an offical recognition of it that
would not be due if your had
entered the service at the bottom
& by competetion -- but you obtained


it by honor as it were & it is a very
honorable & dignified post, that of
an Assit. Dorector -- it is removed
from & high above aniy clerkship
-- it is a thing apart -- though poorly


paid - & not the less honorable on that
account -- It now strikes me that
it would be well not to
delay to know your
sense of the office as such, quite
independent of personal consideration, or
the good of the establishment.


This is a delightful little hotel.
We dine tomorrow at Lavelier's
& Tuesday at Coopers -- on Wednesday
we start for the South.


I am aff yours
