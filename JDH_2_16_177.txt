The place is doing her also much good
Our appetites are voracious, & we get all
the fresh air we can.
The town is very attractive for
its gardens & the excellence of the private
houses in literally all the suburbs. The
roads every where good & they are timly
literally lined with flowering trees &
opposite the houses & in their gardens
shrubs to an Extent I have never seen
elsewhere. For at least a mile of
every road out of the town there are
eithers
seats at every few yards, & either gas or
electric lights. There is not a public house
to be seen, nor any poverty. It is in fact
a resort of the rich.  Many fine houses
belong to wealthy Leeds & even London
tec
people & the architecture of the houses
great & small is a lesson to London
Villadom.
We are most comfortable in our
th
quarters, facing the huge belt of meadow
