Dear Dyer
Your welcome letter arrived
last night.  We were pretty anxious
to hear how you were impressed
with N Italy. & I am very glad 
indeed to get your early impressions,
which are always worth a dozen
of recollections after reaching home.
I do not wonder at your rapture
over Verona & St Marks at
Venice- but wonder that the
rest of the other features of the
latter did not impress you more,
especially the grand rising of the
seen from
masses of buildings as everywhere
the Canals & sea. Also I always
thought that I never had realised
the power of painting till I
saw the Titians & Paul Veronese in


or Academia I forget which
the Scuola I wholly agree with you
about the Tintorettos -- I never
could abide them.
Everything goes on quite quiet
here, but the R.S. absorbs more
& more of my time, & this
t re
struggle between the Brit Mus
Challenger collection, is about to
come off. I am sent for to the
Treasury on Wednesday, & shall
fight hard for Thomson having
supreme control under a
Consult of the R S. The Treasury
are apes to have meddled in
the affair, & I do not think the
Admiralty have acted well in 
the collection to
transferring

the Herb. A Bailiff of the
Parks has been appointed
in the shape of a 1/2 pay officer of
R.E.- who has been a road
surveyor in Yorkshire. He is to
have some £4-500 -- & I think
has £1200 a year of his own.
The appt is said to be Mitford's
making! Callender disapproves of it.
Humphrey's has been making
tender enquiries after you. I
have told him that you may
be back about 22nd, but
pray do not let this hurry you
but stay on:-- he wants you for
some examination.

germinated, but I fear are killed
by some carelessness! Lynch drives
one wild & is again growling for pay.
The more I see of an establishment
like this, the more confirmed I am
in my opinion that it takes a
deal more Science to manage it
than could be believed. & not
so much Scientific mind perhaps, as
Scientific method; in fact it requires
high Scientific culture & instinct too.
Lynch has lost all the Nares plants.
We have a young Welwitschia a foot
long that looks possible.
The No 4 is miserable & I have
told Smith to get rid of Seward - I
cannot stand it. You or I must
take that House in hand.
But I had no intention of
bothering you with shop.
We go immediately to Allman for 3

days, when I shall work on
