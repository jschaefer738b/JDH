SUNNINGDALE.
My dear Dyer
Thanks for your letter.
The approval of the residence selected
by my father-- simply applied to
the site in respect of proximity to
the Garden. The Board never troubled
their heads further The £200 covered,
or should have covered, rent, rates,
taxes & repairs, which of course it
did not. From some correspondence o
his with my Grandfather I find he

that were to be lined with book
--shelves & plant cabinets, which of
course he put up & painted himself.
The Works dept at Kew never even
saw the house (the inside that is) nor
did a single thing to it & he employed
his own gardener.
When he left it, 14 rooms were
full of books & plants. The Ferns
(of the Herbarium)
alone were accommodated at the
Director's House in Kew when he went there.
I do not suppose I ever told you
that from 1810 or before it, till his
death, he purchased every botanical
book he could lay hands on; chiefly
though agents in London; and when in
Glasgow the trouble & expense of this

Cmpy (Iron-founders, hence "Carronards")
that undertook this. I find by the
correspondence alluded to, that in Novr  1841
he had overdrawn his account at the
Bank by £1,600! & had then no end
of outstanding bills, including upward of
£60 to Cuming and upward of £80 to
Taylor & co for work done on "Musci

Ceylon Flora off my hands I shall set to
work to get more.

He had to present a Grandson, a quiet youth
just appointed to a Halifax Regt and
smothered in military millinery, the
extravagant gaud of which is a thing to
dream of. -- How the Govt. can sanction it is
 a marvel. The very waistcoat, worn under
the shell-- jacket is one mass of gold embroidery on
White Satin! -- beautiful indeed. His outfit

can do with in a very quiet cavalry Regiment
for which no examination is required!!!
