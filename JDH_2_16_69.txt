Dear Dyer
I am very glad to
get your letter & find that you
& Harriet have enjoyed yourselves


so much -- Pray do not hurry
back -- there is nothing to bring
(gardens)
& I have just --
you to Kew
completed the estimates.


You will be glad to hear that
I have installed Walters in the
Palm Houses, & I like much
what I have seen of him in


it. He is very timid about
any shifting of your arrange--
ment, but I have told him
that no such arrangement is


final, nor can be so, for that
the plants will grow, & that he,
not you, will be responsible for
this being regarded:-- that we shall
always be ready to advise him


but we expect he will soon not
want our advice except for any
great changes. Moore is off in


high dudgeon -- & has not behaved
to Smith or to me
at all well. I have packed off
Leighton too, who is a sulky
ill conditioned morgrel.


Watson has taken the Orchids with
a will, & I anticipate qreat
things from the change.
As to Burt (or whatever
his name


is) I am at my wits end what
to do.-- he certainly attends better
to the grounds than any predecessor
but as for No 2 it is awful.


I get a great deal of good
work out of Truelove by daily
supervision; but he is far
off
& 2 trips a day to the woods
takes up a great deal of time.


Smith has had a very bad
attack of siatica that quite
disabled him, but is better &
he has been more active since.
The Museums progress but the


stair--case in No 1 is a horrid failure
for its going up the wrong way (as you
pointed out.)

long as you are happy holidaying.
I will tell you if any thing occurs in which
you might be needed.
I think I have got Smith to

settle nothing till you return.
