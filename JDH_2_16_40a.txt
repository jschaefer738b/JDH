Your letter has been a great pleasure
to me. I thank you especially for your
interest in Charlie in respect of whose
future I intensely agree with you. I did
hope that I should have interested
him in some higher branch of his
profession -- or at least in the theory of
it. I so keenly feel the deficiencies of
my own early education & fancy (perhaps
quite wrongly) that if I had had
the advantages that modern thought
& education has extended to
Medicine & Surgery, I should have been


a much better naturalist than I am
I also cannot help thinking that the

time will come when Charlie
I do) regret the loss of a good foundation in

Strachey lent his Camera to Harriet

As to Astilbe & Spiraea I well remember

San Francisco is a horrid place
& the country about it vile looking --
bare red hills all around: still
the quantity of interesting herbaceous
plants one sees is astonishing, &
in spring the whole country is said to

I can well believe) where nothing but
red earth & dust is now to be


seen. Bolander has cut Botany & taken

wagons, ponys, mules & our legs
we get over a monstrous deal of ground

enormous deal of Botany en-route.
This is a queer climate, fancy my
being cold during the day, with an overcoat
on & my thick scotch plaid -- all through
the strong W. wind over the Pacific:
which blows, usually with thick fog
at this season, every afternoon. You see
ladies wrapped in furs every where.
I was delighted to see the Pacific again


& pick up macrocystis on it's shores, a
plant I had not seen for 35 years & which
brought back a host of memories of perils
by sea shores with messmates long since
gathered to their fathers. Also I found
to day for the first time Nereocystis, a
magnificent algae I had long hoped to
see "in the parenchyma". -- The sandy
sea banks were clothed with Fragrans

I hope to write from this to Willy &
Mr Smith -- With much love to Harriet,

latter
the having passed the college -- I wish he
had written to me. --
