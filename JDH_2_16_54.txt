Dear Dyer
Thanks for yours of yesterday
1. I hope the I.O. letter about
the I. Mus. collections will
be sent on to us at once &
we must enforce our terms.
The sterile tract to the east
avenue I thought of: my
chief objection was, that it
was rather too near a main
path & wou the Gallery
would be made a rest house
of in a greater degree than
we should like I should





 prefer it where it would help
to draw the public off the
main routes.
3 I never did like our white
glass-houses -- & should be glad
stone color, brown
of any shade of either blue
 or green
or red introduced outside
& red or blue inside. Pray
use your judgement. The red
will suit our gravel.
4 I send Mr Noel's letters.
5 I shall offer to Miss North
to be at Kew on Friday 29.
leaving this by the night
train of Thursday, & returning





8 I am sorry for Wall, but not
very. Their men put all their
eggs into one basket & suffer
accordingly.
I am groaning over a long
supplement of Williamson's to
his R. S. paper on Traquairia
which he finds (apparently) is
the sporange of Lepidonotus &
Anellides that they are macro
spores!!! The whole question
is "in" an "Eugonic" state.

Ever alf y

Sun out at last!
P.S. I return the letter about Taylor
which will do extremely well.
Please file Miss North's & Mr Noel's letters
