The Camp
Dec2/
My dea Dyer
Though I fear I must not
congratulate you on the honor
that you have received, I must
express my sincere pleasure : feeling
that you deserved it. I own to it's
touching my pride, that it should
down
go down as an honor to my family,
both on your own account & on
Harriet's. Also I am proud of it
in view of the lustre it reflects on
Kew. Happily it need not carry
with it, in your case, as it does & ever
will in mine, the keen sense of the
neglects my father's services met
with at the hands of the govt.
