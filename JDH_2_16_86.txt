Sept 20/82


Dear Dyer
Things go on smoothly enough
here. Smith is always away holidaying
in London with wife & daughter & I
am glad of the quiet for writing


my letters & getting a lot of work done
in the Herbarium, where I have been
a day
giving two hours aday to the
Arboretum collections. The Palms
still occupy a great deal of my time.
& I am not yet free of them. The
order is as it were riddled with
holes, in so far as the published
genera


account of these goes, & the largest
is hence a warren of pit--falls &
snares, so that I find myself often
on the wrong tack both in Museum
& Herbarium, & I must fear that
when I come to rearrange the


Museum ones, for the new room
I shall find egregious blunders
in my work from mismatching on
one hand & failing to detect
identily of parts on the other.


I am doing this in revising the
two herbarium collections, & it is
not pleasant or assuring.
The mason's work of your room
is nearly finished & the sashes are


being put in.
The new Foremen seem to be very
industrious & willing.
Yes, I thought the title -- page of


the Darwin notices far too.
pretentious.
Mr Porter (the Nancy man) came
work
for 10 days at the Museum, he is
a connection of the Barnards, a likely


youth, he tells me to day that it is 
arranged that Cooper's hill takes half
the Nancy men at once -- he has a
profound contempt for the whole
Nancy teaching, & complains of not


having Botany enough to make
good use of the Museums contents.
Mallet writes that the Govt. of
India cannot sanction Watts
return to Mannopore -- & adds that if


I saw Barings' letter I would be
quite satisfied -- I have answered
that I had never asked anything
but Watts' appt. as Residency


Surgeon at M. -- according to the
own
Residents wishes -- that the sending
him on the survey was none of my


doing (but having done this they
should have let him finish his
work.)
No news about the Madras
appt. -- Walker writes sore about
not having been consulted, & is
getting you Cycads. Two C. siamensis 


are showing cones.
Balfour has been to see his father
whose mind is gone. Baker, Jackson &
Bliss are all away.
Jurd to begin moving the Gates at


once -- I have selected a place rather
nearer the archway & quite 300 yards
from the Gallery & 100 from the Richmond
Gate.
We are packing Guy's things for Russia,


& a lot more are going to Kings.
The weather has been quite fine here
but not warm, though I fear that the
Equinoctials are brewing.
The Kew x affair is put off till November,
meanwhile Mrs Harrison wants me to addess
the Home Sec. on the subject of closing the
x yard. I have written to Bateman for advice
-- he is at Soc. Sc. Conrgress.  If I take it up I 
must communicate with the Vicar, I suppose
I hear he is going to have Newbould for
curate!!!
I go to Bagshot every Saturday, but next
will be my last. I shall probably go to Malvern
next week for Sunday, wishing to see Symonds who
is very poorly with his asthma & heart.
With best love to Harriet.
Yours of 18 arrived yesterday.  Yours affec.
