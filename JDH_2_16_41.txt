My dear Dyer
I have at last returned to
Eastern American civilization &
without regret, for I am pretty
well fagged out with the hard
work of our occidental trip. I
have stopped here a day to
spend it with my friend Prof
Eaton who with his new bride
staid at Kew in 1866 & was much

with us -- he was & is a great fern
man, & is bringing out an illustrated
book on the Ferns of the U States.
New Haven is a wonderfully pretty 
be said
place & this indeed may
all
of the Eastern States that I have
seen -- they are all so green varied in
scenery wooded watered & grassed with
the ocean in addition on the sea-board.
We travelled Eastward day &
night for 6 days & nights from


Nat Hist at the Central Park & the
Park itself; briefly meeting (through
Grays forthought) Bickmore the head
that
of one & Olmstead of the other. At
3 PM I took the train to here, where
I spent today (Sunday) & go on tomorrow
to Boston & Cambridge. Here are
Marsh, Dana & Brewer from the
first & last of whom (Dana I have
yet
not seen)I have got some most
valuable information. -- Marsh is busy
with the huge Dinosaurs which
have been discovered at 9000 ft elev. in
the Rocky Mts. & of which I think I
told you I had seen bones at
es
bo
Arkansas Canon & which bones it appears
were procured for Marsh. This
(if it was a beast)
beast must have been 70 ft. long
& Marsh identifies it sits with
the Wealden
Brewer (a Dutchman, originally
Brouwer), is a sharp Botanist who
the Paupir Surveys
accompanied one of


into California & has helped me
with some good details as to the distribution
of the Pines &c. It is a good comfort to
find that Gray & I are at one with
all the experienced ones as to the
limits (specific) of the Pines, so horribly
muddled by nurserymen &
their
collectors.
I am quite thrown out by the taking
off of the Steamer of the 29th & fear that
I shall have to stay at Boston till
return
the 6th as my ticket is only good for
that boat, & I have no chance of a
to myself
cabin (for which I should have to pay)
& the intermediate boat (Wednesday
s
from New York, I hope that this will
not throw you & dear Harriet out)
you & she cannot be more anxious to
sea me
be home than I am to be there -- for
the first time in my long life I look
with pleasure to the ending of a
foreign journey & as it is the delay in
Boston will enable me
ame
for which Oliver will be thankful
collections in Herb. Gray & get on
with
Gray & my Report.
&I hope too write
my
which
R. S. Address
something for


for you with every aid away. Jackson ought
himself & I will
to be ashamed of
him a talking to
if necessary give
talk over with
Granger I must
you. After all you see the raising such
men as Jackson, Moore, Brown &c to positions
that render it most difficult for us to
get rid of them is a great evil. -- they are
never thoughtful & presume upon our
goodness. I quite think with you as to
Nicholson playing a game as soon as he
goes he will turn round & abuse Kew
& there are depts of the O. of W in which
he may do a great mischief.
As to discipline of constables &c it never
will be good till Smith has a systematic
inspection of them by some trusty
deputy. This was to have been one of
assistant duties -- but Smith never
would put Nicholson on it.
Your letter is so full that I could be
all day answering it & I have loads of
others to write. Thank God I am quiet here!
I am utterly sick of travelling & collecting & feel
like a dray horse kept at the gallop for 3
months. A thousand thanks for your kindness
to Charlie. I knew he could not pass in Chemistry
& told him so over & over again
