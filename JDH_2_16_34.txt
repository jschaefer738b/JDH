Dear Dyer

We passed the grant of Â£20
in Committee of Recommendations
today.
The Association has on the whole
been a good but not a remarkable
one- & Section D has not
been below the average. The
sectional addresses have been
I think better than usual.
I told you that Andrews was
poor & Newton's wretched.
Sct A has been strong under
Sir W.Thomson, whose activity
of intellect & body seem to


Glen Coe, Kingussie & so to 
the Grants. Address c/o
Sir J.P. Grant KCB,
The Doune, Aviemore,
NB.
I am glad that you had a
run to Yarmouth; if you had
never before seen it, the environ
ment must have
struck you
as vy irregular.
Ever sincerelyys
JosDHooker
