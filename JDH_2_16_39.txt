My dear Dyer
I must answer your
if
notes however briefly
,
to say how gratified I am
only
at having received them.
I sent your wife & books
by passenger train yesterday
to Betws-y-coed. -- & have no
news of any consequence about
the Gardens. Except that I found
had (between ourselves) signs
of yielding on the part of the
Board in the matter of the
Wall. I have sent two
most vigorous remonstrances
& have held out the prospect

of the counter--cries of "Jobbery
& "Kew in danger" -- together
with a deputation of the
Horticultural interest on
our side. Mitford has
promised to be firm, & will
be so I do not doubt.
but the opposition of Engleheart
& the Selwyn people & Stock
& Co is furious. If danger
threatens I must leave it to
you & Smith to go move the
Gardening papers & Horticultural
interest in our favor.
I have written complaining of
stuff
the atrocious stuff that Carless

to let Carless bring in his bad
stuff till Smith shut the
gates in the faces of the carts.
Gregory has just left; he
is quite disposed to take
Morris & I am to write him
a letter for him to take to
C.O. about him. He will
write to Ceylon to treat Hartog
liberally & send him home
with enough to pay his debts.
Morris is quite set upon
going.  & will I think quite
suit.
I have nearly done 3 months
Bot. Mag & will ask Oliver
to look after it -- as heretofore.

Evr affetey
