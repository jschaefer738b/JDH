Sept. 30/81.


Thanks for yours just
 Dear Dyer
received with the good news of Harriet,
to whom we give our love. 
 You are indeed having & most


enjoyable time -- what a host of
friends your have met! I envy
you your visit to Gavarone, I should
like to spend a week there.
Nothing troublesome has occurned


since you left & nothing of moment
stands over for your return -- I have
had lots of visitors -- inter alia the


whole French Royal family minus the
Duc d'Aumale -- my old acqaintances
the Comte de Paris & Duc de Chartres seemed
delighted to pay Kew another visit
Bentham (81 last weck) has his


nephew & niece here, who we have
lunched & dined. Mmd. Ragnal is with
us for a week & will take Reggie back.


Mitford's father in law Lord Airlie, has
died rather suddenty at Denver (Colorado)
-- this will I fear delay Mitfords coming
out, which I very much want.
I think the Palms are all right


again in the P.H. -- they soon recover.
from that yellowing of over -- heating
which we must obviate most summers
by screens.


A great box of Cycad leaves has
arrived for you from Denmark, I have
done my best towards dryring them
between large sheats of paper & give
two on them of the very longest to


Jackson to manipulate betwen wooden
planks
Boards & paper--
Camerons Bangalone Cycas has come 
in very good state & many specimens 



Thaustor has sent back over two cases
full of Palms in capital order
that idiot Muelle (he really is little 
a Wards'
Andersonias (blue fw. Epacrid) from
better than a lunatic) sends case of 3 
through a collector there,
W. Australia -- which he expects will arrive 
in full flower & hopes I will at once 


figure them in 3 consecutive numbers
of the magazine! Of course they arrive
stark dead, though beautifully packed,
& the case in excellent order.


I have had further correspondence
with Maw about the Rock garden, & have
told him what I think, but that
he had better send in his memorial


on his & his cosignees responsibility &
let us see what the Board say -- I have
told him that Barkhouse's settled me
against a "Rock garden" par excellence


but that I was for any amount of
rock gardening at Kew.
in
Smith seems happy at Cornwall
& comes back on the 8th he need not
as far as I am concerned, for I get on  


very well with Nicholson with whom my
mild suppression of his peculiar way of
under a great deal of supervision. He
 speaking of people & things has answered.
I get a great deal of work out of him 
is most sensible of encouragement &
conversly of the cold shoulder.


Wahon goes on all right. I caught
at once.
two lads sky larking in the P.H. last 
week & dismissed them
(after communicating with Walters who was
very pleased) they howled a little.


Nock has not turned up yet
Zohrab has been here, a very intellegent
man, he expects to go to St Thomas.


"Report" not come; I have written to
Reed about it.
daily
Col. Johnstone is (if I read the papers
right ( back in India & organizing his
Munneypore staff! Another letter has


come from Watt., -- which I I have
answered, it will be a terrible pity if
he does not go to Munnepore, but we
can do no more.
Yes the Herbarium is an incubus & the
 B.M. will always be an impediment to





its proper development -- it is an uphill
fight for me & has been for now
15 years as it was to my father for
25 before me.
A more satisfactory letter from
Trimen came today. His Haggala


man is recovering; the Landolphias
arrived in splendid order -- the
2 Cinchonas just alive.
arrived in good order.
The cases to Morris also have 


I am working very hard at the
Arboretum -- it is a wonderfally
collection, but so hard to name.
Nicholson has really made a first


rate Herbarium & deserves great
credit for the zeal & intelligence he
has displayed -- he really works
tremendously hard at the office &
in the Garden, I sometimes fear his


breaking down
Now I must break off as 
Bentham is calling out for a list of
my Palm flowers.


Ever affy yours
Jos D Hooker


he dined with us yesterday, & was
in great force, but I find him
poorly to day.
