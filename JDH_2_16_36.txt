My dear Dyer
I have your three letters &
enclosures received here. That
very
of Prestoe is quite distressing. &
I am quite at a loss what to
do. Please write him a note
by next mail expressing our sympathy
& tell him that I shall go to
the C.O. about it as soon as I
return, but that with only his
"Strictly private & confidential
letter" to act upon, I cannot
do much. The best thing I
can think of would be that
some friend of the Garden in
Trinidad would draw up
a brief statement for the Gardeners


B. A.- I wonder at Lane Fox
What you tell me respecting the
Heveas is most disheartening.
All I can hope for is that if they
are killed, it may bring about
a better state of things as regards
pernaiial
the financial relations of the I. O. & Kew.
-that subject must soon
be grappled with -- but for a row
with Markham, the best thing
would be an official repre-
representation from Kew, approved
by Strachey . whose scientific

position Ld Salisbury acknowledges.
I am not surprized at Thwaite's
not quite liking the job.- he is
getting old & as the "Times" says
of dizzy it age brings experience
but with it the reluctance to


2 Saturdays longer than I
intended
If your "quick wit" can think
of anything for me to say
at the R. S. address I shall
be so much obliged:- I look
with despair on such a session's
work as I had last, & I long
inexpressibly to throw off
the
& society
load of London work & keep

to Kew.
I should like
to say something about Fossil
Botany, & to allude to the
researches
biological matters in which the
instruments exhibited at
S. Kensington are concerned,
but feel sadly incompetent.
I find it so difficult to


concentrate my attention when
subjects new to me, & to take
them all in when I do!
Ever & very affe
JosD Hooker
