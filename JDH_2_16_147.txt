THE CAMP.
SUNNINGDALE.
My dear Dyer
We are shocked & distressed
to hear of your Mother's state: & can
only hope that the operation may
give a longer spell of relief than
you expect.  It recalls my Mother's

case to me: who survived the
operation in her leg longer than we
at one time had reason to hope --
but she was a much younger woman,
& the circumstances are not parallel.
We shall be glad to hear
when the operation is over, & your
mind is, temporarily at any rate,
relieved.


Soper & Reeve before him have
been thorns in my side. They move
in very narrow grooves, but I have
so often sinned in withholding copy
for weeks & months, which is a
worry to the printers -- who visit on the
publisher; that have got callous --
to the greivances[sic] of both, -- & to my
punishment.
I have not a single one of
the Tibetan implements you desiderate,
Except a Tobacco Pipe, & this being
wholly of brass is hardly suitable:--
it is further my only objective
memento of my "durance Vile vile,"
when it was a Solace of a sort.
Your request reminds me that
I have still your inscribed slab!

Shall I send it up?.
The Brit Mus want to purchase
my portrait of R. Brown *3.  I told them
that Kew or the R.S. had a
im
cla
prior option of possession, but I
suspect that it is beyond your
means.
