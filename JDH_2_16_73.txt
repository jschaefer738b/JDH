Castellamare
March 23d/81.


My dear Dyer
I received your letter last


night, it said nothing of your health
so I hope that you & Harriet & the children
are "all right". We came on here after
a day at Rome & one at Naples, of
which places we have seen but little


as yet -- though we have made two
visits to the latter from here, seeing
the Museum on both occasions & Dohrns
Aquarium on the last. Dohrn himself
we also saw, & he was very polite


showing us round & asking as to
come again; his Aquarium is really
magnificent. -- I never saw one so


well kept nor (of course) so rich. The
Crinoids were in grand condition with
stems a yard high -- Octopus was in
perfection -- a yard across the arms or
ordinary
more -- their ordinary habits are most curious
quite unlike any case I had formed of the

their arms with

quivering all over with the respiratory
movements, changeing color & waggling


about : the two great eyes protruding from

too astonished me, flattening itself out
half buried in the graved of the bottom,


undistinguishable.

shape in the twinkling of an eye & darting

its lateral fins & goes backwards or

corals, Madrepores, Melobesias, Diptera
Beroe Crustacea & Medusias immeasurable
except Melobesia, Ulva & one or two
swarmed in the tanks. Of plants of plants


of the Olive series I saw few -- & no
red ones--
Turning to art the statuary in the
Museum is marvellous, -- A head of Homer
I thought the finest thing I ever saw in


sculpture. Of Venus' there are no end, but
only one of them seemed to me to excell
it is after the manner of she of Milo.
The Pictures are too mixed in lot to
interest, or rather I should say to please
for there are many of grat great excellence
& some as curious in a historical point


of view. -- still one or two of them in the
Vatican (of which more when I shall
have seen more) are worth all all Naples
put together.
More valuable by far are the mural
decorations removed bodily & successfully


from the walls of Pompeii & the collection
of domestic utensils from the latter, best

It is impossible to give you an idea idea
of the number & variety of these articles,
or the marvellous artistic beauty of many


of them. Many are recent discoveries

day out are wonderful, some of them
quite equal to any thing that Salviati
turns out: I mean in point of the


skilful manufacture. One glass plate

cobalt centres to each star. It is
tremendously smashed, but the
workmanship was perfect from centre
to circumference -- Then there is a

Pompeii we have twice visited, it
is exactly what you read about, but I
got extrordinarily interested in the manner,
of its interment, which I do not quite

stories remain: -- if they were burnt, as
supposed, they must have left quantities
of charcoal amongst the debris below, & in
the holes where the joists went, but
I could find none; nor any in the
sections of the cliffs where the excavations,


thus communicated. The town was a very

H I wrote to Prof. Palmieri of the
Met. Obs at Vesouvius, but hear he is
gone to Rome, I am most anxious
see his instruments. -- If the weather holds
good we shall ascend V. tomorrow
but the Eqiunoctials have set in, with
a furious cold N. E. wind & I am
writing with very cold firgers.
We called at the Bot Garden for Cesati

but did not see at Naples


the Garden is a wretched affair but I have
improved my knowledge of Mediterranean
Pini a little already



We go on Friday to Amalfi, Salerno &
Paestum & so to Naples on Saturday. It
is too windy for Capri & the "White grotto"
& too cold for Monte St Angelo which I was
very anxious to ascend (5000 ft) just above
this.

We saw the death of Mrs Meade in the

way a most excellent choice both for his


sake & for his young daughter's. He had
purchased & furnished his house in Grosvenor

they seemed a most devoted couple. I
wrote at once to Mr Herbert asking him to


convey our sympathy as soon as the he thought
fit, & Lady H is writing to Mr Branston
I fear that this blow will crush the poor fellow.
