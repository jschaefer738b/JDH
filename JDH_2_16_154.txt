My dear Dyer
I return Poulton with
many thanks, it has interested me
greatly. He makes too much of Huxley --
He is quite wrong about Huxley's
answer to the Bp. at Oxford, & it's
effect is all through Newton's desire
to belittle belittle both, calling it a
'drawn battle'! I have written to
F. Darwin about it. As to Pangenesis
, it was as the 'parting of the ways' with
Darwin and me. I never could even
grasp
entertain the notion of what were
neither molecular nor atom.
Your estimate of Hodgson is very
just -- as we knew him in the


 mildewed condition of his later
life. He was a very different being
as I knew him at Darjeeling (i.e.
when well there), full of animation
& brimming over with information.
irreverence,
I could understand Yule's irreveren
but I cannot the objection founded on
his so called marriage, or alliance
to a "Mohomdea Lady"! as Hunter,
with what I can only suppose to be with
humourously calls it her. She was
Katman
just a girl out of the Bazaar, at
du
a Hindoo I suppose, who Hodgson no doubt
bought. At Darjiling she lived in one
room of a hut behind H's bungalow,
with one native woman to attend on
her, & Hodgson told me that he had
no communication with her, & very rarely




the house is being turned upside down
for a children's party.
