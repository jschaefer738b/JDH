Dear Dyer
card & to know the cause of your
I was very glad to get your 
disturbed circulation -- you must


keep quiet till you are quite better.
Please let me hear again on receipt.
Lord Rosebery has applied for the Ladoes
Indian order for Miss North, & sends
me 2 answers from the P.S. of the


Sec. of State, & the other from Sir H.F.
both
Ponsonby pointing out that she is
inadmissable under the statates of
the order -- Sir F. Ponsonby "quite


agrees that Miss North deserves
"some mark of favour "-- so something
may come of this -- Meanwhile Mr
Lord Rosbury asks me to consider the
communation as confidential.


think Lord S. is an earest man.
I have cut up one copy of the
can make, & if, when you see it, you
guide into the best arrangement 
think it would be for the best, I 
will piece it on my return from 


Scotland.
Dach writes word, that he has
same
asked for (500 ft to inch) & that
done both Garden & P.G. to scale as I 


the Lithographer will begin about
beginning of August.
A notice of Mme Cammile's book is in
today's times, neither does it guage


the incredible ignorance of the man
who it calls a good geologist, Botanist
& Zoologist! -- as for his Botany he
positively did not know Monocot, from
lending
 Dicot. You really should get the book if
   it in Eastbourne library, it is quite a curiousity.


Balfour called -- no news except that
he had heard that Frazer was over age,
& that the top man would be a pupil
of Lawrence at Oxford, of whom he


spoke most highly.
(Aden)
Brig. Gen. Blace has not turned up,
I see he asks for a 'Wards' case of Vine
August when he is the in England,
cuttings to be ready by begining 
giving London address. I have 
London address
written suggesting that he should
have the Vine cuttings in October &


take other things in the case.
Harris died yesterday.
Has Harriet seen any thing by
Muller
old Mrs Chas Mualler who was so


good to me at Darjeling, & spent
some weeks with me at Kew
when she was a very little girl. She
dabbles in Nat. Hist.
Smith was poorly recently
with gripes & cold sweats, but 


is better today. I leave told him 
as to be careful.


Bless has a child ill with
scarlet fever, & is ordered to
keep his distance.
With love to Harriet -- glad she
is so much better.
I am aff. yours
