THE CAMP.
SUNNINCDALE.
My dear Dyer
Presumably it was Aiton
inspired by Brown who engineered
the transfer of the Bauer drawings
to the Brit. Mus. Bot. Dept.
I well remember Miss Alderson
as a constant visitant for days together
at my Aunt's, Lady Palgrave's, at
Hampstead. Both Frank & Gifford were
over head & ears in love with her, & I
recognised her at once the Passionate
Pilgrim.
I am in agonies over the forms
of Impatiens Balsamina , & have been


for a month: the Devon Peninsula is it's
headquarters, & the forms are startling -
yet never suggesting a specific difference
--
to me at least.  In every case I have
to dissect a flower under water, which
with the removal from the mounting
often takes 2 hours. I sketch every one,
& all parts on the Herb sheets & keep the
"preparations" gummed on slips of paper in
a capsule on the sheet.
The Madras Herbarium specimens have
been a heavy labor -- I very much want
the drawings that Harriet has in hand.
Thanks for the photo of the house; it
looks very nice & will no doubt
prove so.
I made an effort to see the Antarctic
sketches with my legs bandaged up to


the knees (but not painfull), & they are
marvellous in number interest &
execution -- No naval exped ever did
& bodies
the like -- the heads of birds by Dr
Wilson are the perfection of orni
-thological drawing & coloring -- they are
absolutely alive.
I hope you will enjoy your short
holiday with Harriet.

Ever affy
Jos D Hooker.
