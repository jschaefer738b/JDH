My dear Dyer
Yesterday began with
glorious weather, & we took
advantage of it to go to Edinburgh
with Colvile, -- where I saw my
sister, Mrs McGilvray -- also
Balfour & Dickson. The former
looks completely broken, & is as
yellow as a Guinea. Isaac had
left home that morning
for Glasgow.
I asked Dickson about
W. Thomson, but I could not
make out that he was so ill


as to justify my talking of a
successor. Dickson had seen
him quite lately, said he
was better, but much broken.
His attack was convulsive,
& probably connected with the
kidneys, as he had had
symptoms of albuminuria
some time previously.
I saw Sadler -- the gardens
are in good keep, & very much
has been done to them. The
Palm House was in first-
rate order! New tubs & new
paint every--where.


The Rock Garden is very rich
indeed, but a cockney affair
in its main features & not
suited to Kew. Still the
in splendid flower
number of species ^ is very
remarkable, & they are in
excellent order as to naming.
I telegraphed to you from
Edinburgh, the idea having
occurred to me over-night,
that a private note to Mitford,
showing up Taylor, & Wilkie's
inability to realise the responsibility
of their position, as shown by
Taylors neglect, & the consequences
to Smith would be of more
avail with him, than an official
complaint
put him
letter which would


to the trouble of enquiring &
& reprimanding against the grain.
I should like to impress upon him
the fact that it is an affair for
Hunts opinion to be final upon.
Though so fine a morning, the
afternoon rained, & it continued
to rain most of the night. We
had torrential showers this
morning, & a fine cold afternoon
It is a glorious night, & if tomorrow
is fine we shall take Stirling
& the Trossachs returning at night.
Ever aff
