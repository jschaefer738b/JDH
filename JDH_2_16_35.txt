Skye Sept 21./76.
My dear Dyer
I hope you do not think that
I am never more to appear at Kew:
the fact is that the exceptionally
fine weather in this most fickle
of climates has tempted me to
make all the use I can of the opportunity
it affords of seeing a country which
is not much worth two visits (if
one!).  Much as I had heard of 'Skye
the inaccessible' I expected great
things & though perhaps I have
no right to be disappointed (seeing
how incredulous I am of descriptions
of scenery) yet I am so. The island
is a huge bog with the exception
main
of its few points of interest which
consist of two specks on its surface
characterised by very remarkable rock


scenery, & one mountain tract
limited lofty & savage in a high
degree, with a rather contemptible
latter the
lakelet in its bosom, the theme
of more misrepresentations, articles
& description, than any spot on the
globe known to me -
Of the rock scenes the finest is the
Queraing, which consists of the one
side of a mountain top of basalt
being dislocated in as singular &
striking a marvel as it is possible
to imagine:-- no description had
given me any idea of its remarkable
character -- nor can I say after seeing
it, to what it is indebted for its
unique character; whether to in action,
sea action or convulsions, but should
suspect the latter, with much subsequent
aerial action. The substrata is a
black tough basalt, with little vegetation
though I found Silene acaulis, Arabis
petraea, Oxyria, Antennaria & other
rocks
subalpines. These blasted place (the


coast; & thence back to Portree -- not
a house beast or bird were seen, but
a very few sheep, & a very large species
of frog unknown to me.
Lock Arnish & the Coolin hills are the
most interesting features of Skye &
thither we went 2 days ago,
by
crack 91/2 miles to Sligachan, a lone
tourist hotel in a wilderness of bog.
Thence an 8 miles  march up a very
broad uninteresting flat- mound
glen by a rude path over stones
bogs & torrent beds, takes you to
a steep rise of some 1500 ft at
top of which you see the lower end
of the far famed Loch Arnish &
here the guides try to persuade you
that they have done their duty.
We however went on a few miles
flank
further along the stub edge of the
valley overhanging the Lake & got a
good view of its upper end which


352
is overhung by the savage black & most
written
Coolins
(
rugged cliffs of the saw-topped, Cuilathion
this was very fine;-- not so the Lake
itself, which instead of being girdled
by black cliffs plunging into its blacker
waters was encircled by green sloping
Engler
banks! Laden with transported boulders.
From thence Mrs Hooker & I ascended a
rocky mountain about 1000ft higher
& obtained one of the finest views I ever
looked upon of the Western Islands from
Morvern
Rum & Egg to Mull & almost the whole
Scotch coast from Ben Cruachan & Argyle
round to Sutherland. The look down
from the top - sheer down - to the Lakes
& sea below was indescribably grand
as were the other Coolin peaks cones
& sierras that surrounded us.
The glacial features of the valley cannot
be exaggerated in point of interest &
the pitch-black rocks being very steep &
glaciated, & the erratics scattered like
as if titanic pills had been emptied
over all the valley & at all elevations, which
for 2000 ft up they hang 'on by the eylids' to



cliffs & were strewed over ledges &
were so poised on sloping cliffs that
you saw them
you would fancy they were sliding down
being held in position by the exceedingly
rough surface of the rock, the hypersthene
cristels of which project from its surface
like studs on a boot heel, & render
it  easy & safe to move along slopes of
30o & upwards, without ever a suspicion
of slipping. The walk back from our
elevated position & along the dreary
valley was a terrible fatigue & we
did not get to the Sligachan Hotel till
near 8 PM.  Except for about 4 miles
of a pony-back, Mrs Hooker walked &
we
climbed it all, & bad as it was much
preferred it to the bog trot that we had
to the Storr on the previous trip.
The Geology of the Island is most-
interesting, but not objectiory so
it must have taken much time
patience experience & knowledge
to have recognised the Miocene,
Lias, & lower beds that are
here


my discovery of the fossil wood in Kerguelans
land will find its place in the geological
history of the Southern regions. I am greatly
disappointed at none of the later
Expeditions having searched there for
leaf-beds.
e have had here Mrs Lyell & son &

daughter, Miss Lyell (Sir Cha- sister)&
Mr Symonds -- they left yesterday for
the Gair Loch & we follow tonight.
Tomorrow night we sleep at Inverness,
& on Saturday reach Aviemore, & then
as soon as Scotch hospitality will let
us away, go to Stirling to see my sister
an
& a an old college & India friend for a
night - then to Sir J Colvilles for 3
nights near Dunfermline & so
home. A letter might reach me at 
Aviemore, - but P.O. Stirling would
be safer.
The weather has been perfect on
the whole & the sea beautifully calm.
With Kind regards to Oliver and
Smiths. Ever my dear Dyer
