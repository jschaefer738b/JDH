Dear Dyer
All goes on well here
Mr Smith returned on Saturday
in robust health, & with a fine
complexion. Nicholson has


gone away on leave -- very

much done up.

Cross flatly refused to take
my orders about the Cinchonas,
& I found that he had
been corresponding with the


I. O. about them. I at once
telegraphed to Danvers my
telegraph crossed on official

letter enclosing one from



copy of
one from Cross to I.O. in which
he as good as refuses to go out


except with all the plants.
accompanying
The I.O. ask me (in the letter

to me) whether I have any
reason to change my views

in regard to what plants
should go. I answer that I
have none, that I have
carefully examined the plants



with Watson & Smith & that

we are agreed that it would
be folly to send the three
little plants. This brought
orders to me to instruct
Cross to take out only the three





big plants.
Danvers says that Cross' little
game is to take all out, & that

if all die he will be sent
back again to America for


more.
Welwitschia seeds are growing
splendidly.
More Cow-tree seeds have come.


I am having 2 Wards' cases planted
with them, to send where you
think best.
Bulbophyllum Beccarii has been here
for figuring, its stench is so horrible
that poor Miss Smith, who has
been most brave about it, was


obliged to knock under. The
leaves are like coal scuttles, the
bunch of flowers very poor, &
the odor the worst I know in the
Veg. Kingdom & the most obtrusive.
I have surveyed the whole Arboretum


with Smith & reduced the lawn
mowing by one half -- Smith will
see to the K. of Hannover Grounds
with me.


Juid is getting paper to paper
at the Museum when the breaking
through takes place -- I keep
Jackson at work:--


Old DC & his wife are
coming to London about the
18th to meet the A. Grays.
I am forever with Reeve
about the coloring of Bucklandia
plate, & have written to him


that he cannot expect Mrs Dyer
to do any more drawings for him

for that both I as Editor & she
as artist, are disgraced by such


our
reproductions of the work. I fear
it is all of no use. I hope that
he pays the colorist 30/ per 100!
Ever affy yours
JDHooker
