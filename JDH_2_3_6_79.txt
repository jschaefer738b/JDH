Dear Hemsley
I returned yesterday & have to
day been working at the Icone's Plates -- I
still want the &I. extense & I. ganpiuana)
to make up the 16 please let me have
Icones plates of Impatiens
them.
Could I have a set of the 14, which
are made upon specimens Lent by
Paris sent to Lecomte to be placed
with their specimens & their Herbn. &
I strongly advised Lecomte to have
drawings or photographs made of Miss
Smith's drawings of the Chinese species
in Herb. Paris, & he gladly accepts the
of them.
loan for which he will apply to the
Director & have photographs taken.
I will send them to the host to be


fowarded as soon as I hear further
The Director was for sending the
ornineals as a gift to Paris, & our having copies
made. -- this as an acknowledgement of
the loan of the specimens -- but I think they
are well paid by the 6 months hard labor
I have had in Olegisfying depicting drawing,
& describing then --
Am I to be allwed any more Icones
Part
plates? -- I expected in whole number at
least I will gladly subscribe Â£20 00
in aid
Lecom writes that he may have
received more plants recently from China
& Indo China, &asks my authority to
send them (for examination, I suppose)
For I should of course, ask them to
be sent to Kew direct. shall I do so?
he does not say that there are any Impatiens
amongst them.
