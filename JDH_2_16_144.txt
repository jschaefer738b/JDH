My dear Dyer
I have gone into Callitris,
& am satisfied that, whatever shd
be done with Widdringtonia, Tetraclinis
should stand. It differs wholly from
Widdringtonia & Callitris in the
character of its articulations -- as
indeed the two last do from
one another, & if you throw in the
geographical Element you have
3 as good genera as can well be --
Tetraclinis -- N. Africa
1833)
Pachylepis alias Widdringtonia (1842)
S. Africa
180
Callitris Australia.
With love & hearty good wishes
from us to you all Evr affy yrs

Stapf will complicate my work
by what he is doing with the
African grasses -- These come
to hard blows with the Indian
as well as with those of
their own house!. &
require me to make
alterations even in
proofs & revises!
It only shows up
the state of the
order!
