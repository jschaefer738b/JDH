My dear Dyer
We had a very hard
day's work at the Herbarium
yesterday which we found in


disappointingly bad order
-- in fact in a complete muddle.
All will be ready to go to
Kew tomorrow -- about 20
cases in a van that will


go through.
The loan Herbaria are
terribly mixed, but
Bentham has offered to


sort them out at Kew.
There then will be the
General Herbarium to deal


say what will be best done
 with & I am at a loss to
with it -- as insects are busy


in it, & we shall want
none of it but the grasses,


as far as I can see.
The weather is most
miserable, glormy, cold &
drizzly with mist -- vegetation


is very little advance of
Kew if at all. The House very cold.


We go on to Torquay tomorrow.
Bentham will return straight
on Monday, as he does not


now wish to break the
journey. I shall stop at
Exeter & visit some of the
old family haunts, though


I do not expect to make
out any thing.
with best love to Harriet.
& the bairns.


Ever affly yours
JD Hooker
